<p class="drop-cap">THE languid quiet of midday lay upon
the little road-house that stood guard by
Verde Crossing. Old Crit and his wild Texas
cowboys had left the corral at dawn, riding out
mysteriously with their running irons in their
chaps; the dogs had crawled under José Garcia's
house and gone to sleep; to the north the
Tonto trail stretched away vacant and only
the brawling of the Verde as it rushed over the
rocky ford suggested the savage struggle that
was going on in the land. Within the adobe
fort that served for both store and saloon Angevine

<p class="i1">"Yore maw will be singin' a different tune
if you don't hurry home with that lard," counselled
Babe, but seeing that she was in no mood
to depart he cleared his throat to sing. "You
don't know how bad this makes me feel, Marcelina,"
he said, rubbing his hand over his bald
spot and smoothing down his lank hair, "but
I'll sing you the first verse—it ain't so bad."
He stood up and turned his eyes to heaven; a
seraphic smile came into his face, as if he saw
the angels, and in a caressing tenor voice he
began:&mdash;</p>

<p>A pause followed his last words and the
singer limped in behind the counter. "Well,
that's all, now," he said, waving her away, "go
on home, child—can't you see it makes me
feel powerful bad?"</p>

<p>The girl smiled with the sweet melancholy
of her race. "I like to feel bad," she said.
"Sing about the wind."</p>

<p>Angevine Thorne looked down upon her and
shook his head sadly. "Ah, Marcelina," he
said, "you are growing up to be a woman."
Then he sighed and began again:—</p>

<p>A rapt silence, such as artists love, followed
the last wailing cadence of the song; the stillness
of the desert crept in upon them, broken
only by the murmur of the river and an almost
subterranean thud of hoofs; then with a
jingle of spurs and the creaking of wet leather a
horseman rode up and halted before the door.
The water sloshed in his boots as he dismounted
but he swung into the store with the grace of a
cavalier—a young man, almost a boy, yet
broad-shouldered and muscular, with features
moulded to an expression of singular resolution
and courage. A heavy pair of apron
chaps—sure sign of Texas—cumbered his
limbs and the wooden handle of a Colts forty-five
showed above its holster in the right leg;
for the rest, he wore a new jumper over his
blue shirt, and a broad, high-crowned hat, without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
frills. As the stranger headed for the bar
with business-like directness Angevine Thorne
felt a sudden sense of awe, almost of fear, and
he wondered for the instant if it was a hold-up;
but the Texan simply dropped a quarter on
the counter and motioned to a bottle.</p>

<p>"Two," he corrected, as Babe filled a single
glass; and, shoving the second one towards his
host, who eyed it with studied unconcern, the
cowboy tossed off his own and looked around.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" he inquired, as Babe
moved thoughtfully away; "swore off? All
right, you drink the chaser, then," and leaving
the superfluous glass of water on the bar
he drank the whiskey himself.</p>

<p>"Ughr! That's the real old tarantula-juice,"
he observed, as the fiery liquor made
him shudder. "Since when did you swear
off?"</p>

<p>"Six weeks," responded Babe, shortly.
"How's Texas?"</p>

<p>"All right," replied the cowboy. "Did it
git away with you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yep," returned the bar-keeper. "Don't
like to talk about it—say, is they anybody left
in Texas?"</p>

<p>The stranger gazed at him shrewdly for a
moment, and a grim light came into his eye.</p>

<p>"Don't like to talk about it," he said, "but
now you speak of it I know of one feller, for
sure—and dam' badly left, too. May be
around on crutches by now." He glanced out
at his horse, which had just shaken itself under
the saddle, and let his gaze wander to Marcelina.</p>

<p>"Pretty girls you have in this country," he
remarked, turning a little sidewise to Babe, but
watching her from beneath his hat. "Don't
speak any English, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Nope," replied Babe, sullenly, "her mother
don't like cowboys. <i>Oyez, Marcelina, vaya se
a su madre, chiquita!</i>" But though her mother
was calling, the wilful Marcelina did not move.
Like an Aztec princess she stood silent and impassive,
gazing out from beneath her dark
lashes and waiting to catch some further word
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
of praise from this dashing stranger. Undoubtedly,
Marcelina was growing to be a
woman.</p>

<p>"Name's Marcelina, eh?" soliloquized the
cowboy, innocently. "Pity she can't savvy
English—she's right pretty, for a Mex."</p>

<p>At that last unconscious word of derogation
the regal beauty of Marcelina changed to a regal
scorn and flashing her black eyes she strode
towards the door like a tragic queen.</p>

<p>"<i>Gr-ringo!</i>" she hissed, turning upon him in
the doorway, and seizing upon her pail of lard
she scampered up the trail.</p>

<p>"Hell's fire!" exclaimed the <i>Tehanno</i>. "Did
she understand what I said?"</p>

<p>"That's what," replied Babe, ungraciously,
"you done queered yourself with her for life.
She won't stand for nothin' aginst her people."</p>

<p>"Huh!" grumbled the newcomer, "that's
what comes from drinkin' yore pisen whiskey.
I begin to savvy now, Pardner, why you passed
up that sheep-herder dope and took water."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>He grinned sardonically, making a motion
as of a pin-wheel twirling in his head, but the
bar-keeper did not fall in with his jest.
"Nothin' of the kind," he retorted. "W'y,
boy, I could drink that whole bottle and walk
a tight rope. I guess you don't know me—I'm
Angevine Thorne, sometimes known as
'Babe'!" He threw out his chest, but the cowboy
still looked puzzled.</p>

<p>"Did you come through Geronimo," inquired
Babe, returning to the attack, "and
never heard of me? Well then, Pardner, I'll
have to put you wise—I'm Angevine Thorne,
the Champion Booze-fighter of Arizona!"
He dropped back to his pose and the cowboy
contemplated him with grave curiosity.</p>

<p>"Mr. Thorne," he said, holding out his hand,
"my name is Dalhart—Pecos Dalhart, from
Texas—and I'm proud to make your acquaintance.
Won't you have a drink on the
strength of it?"</p>

<p>"Thank you just as much," replied Mr.
Thorne, affably, "but I've sworn off. I've
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
been the greatest booze-fighter of Arizona for
twenty years, but I've sworn off. Never,
never, will I let another drop of liquor pass my
lips! I have been sentenced to the Geronimo
jail for life for conspicuous drunkenness; I
have passed my days in riotous living and my
nights in the county jail, but the love of a good
mother has followed me through it all and now
I am going to quit! I'm saving up money to
go home."</p>

<p>"Good for you," commented Pecos Dalhart,
with the good-natured credulity which men confer
upon drunkards, "stay with it! But say,
not to change the subject at all, where can I
git something to eat around here? I'm ganted
down to a shadder."</p>

<p>"You're talkin' to the right man, son," returned
Babe, hustling out from behind the bar.
"I'm one of the best round-up cooks that ever
mixed the sour-dough—in fact, I'm supposed
to be cookin' for Crit's outfit right now and he
just saws this bar-keep job off on me between
times, so's to tempt me and git my money—when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
I git drunk, you savvy. He's a great
feller, Old Crit—one of the boys up the river
has got a penny Crit passed off on him in the
dark for a dime and he swears to God that pore
Injun's head is mashed flat, jest from bein'
pinched so hard. Pinch? W'y, he's like a pet
eagle I had one time—every time he lit on my
arm he'd throw the hooks into me—couldn't
help it—feet built that way. An' holler!
He'd yell <i>Cree</i> so you c'd hear him a mile if
anybody tried to steal his meat. Same way
with Crit. Old Man Upton over here on the
Tonto happened to brand one of his calves once
and he's been hollerin' about that maverick
ever since. You've heard of this war goin' on
up here, hain't you? Well that's just Old
Crit tryin' to git his revenge. If he's burnt
one U calf he's burnt a thousand and they
ain't cowboys enough in Texas to hold up his
end, if it ever comes to fightin'. This here is
the cow-camp—throw yore horse in the corral
over there and I'll cook up a little chuck—jest
about to eat, myse'f."</p>

</div>

<p class="ac">GOOD EYE, THE MAVERICK KING</p>

<p class="drop-cap">ANGEVINE THORNE was still talking
mean about his boss when the cowboys
came stringing back from their day's
riding, hungry as wolves. At the first dust
sign in the northern pass the round-up cook had
piled wood on the fire to make coals and as the
iron-faced punchers rode up he hammered on a
tin plate and yelled:—</p>

<p>"Grub pile! Come a-runnin'!"</p>

<p>They came, with the dirt of the branding
still on their faces and beards and their hands
smeared with blood. Each in turn glanced
furtively at Pecos Dalhart, who sat off at one
side contemplating the landscape, grabbed a
plate and coffee cup and fell to without a word.
Last of all came Isaac Crittenden, the Boss,
tall, gaunt, and stooping, his head canted back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
to make up for the crook in his back and his one
good eye roving about restlessly. As he rode
in, Pecos glanced up and nodded and then continued
his industry of drawing brands in the
dust. The Boss, on his part, was no more cordial;
but after the meal was finished he took
another look at the newcomer, spoke a few
words with the cook, and strolled over for a
talk.</p>

<p>"Howdy, stranger," he began, with a quick
glance at the brands in the sand; "travellin'
far?"</p>

<p>"Nope," responded Pecos, "jest up the trail
a piece."</p>

<p>A shadow crossed the Boss's face—Upton's
was "up the trail a piece"—but he did not follow
that lead.</p>

<p>"Know any of them irons?" he inquired,
pointing to the sand-drawings, which represented
half the big brands between the Panhandle
and the Gila.</p>

<p>"Sure thing," replied the cowboy, "I've run
'em."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>"And burnt 'em, too, eh?" put in Crittenden,
shrewdly; but Pecos Dalhart was not as
young as he looked.</p>

<p>"Not on your life," he countered, warily,
"that don't go where I come from."</p>

<p>"Of course not, of course not," assented the
cowman, instantly affecting a bluff honesty,
"and it don't go here, neither, if any one should
inquire. A man's brand is his property and
he's got a right to it under the law. I've got
a few cows here myself—brand IC on the ribs—and
I'd like to see the blankety-blank that
would burn it. I'd throw 'em in the pen, if it
was the last act. Where you travellin'?"</p>

<p>He jerked this out as a sort of challenge,
and the cowboy rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"Upton's," he said briefly.</p>

<p>"Upton's!" repeated Crittenden, "and what
do you figure on doin' up there?"</p>

<p>"Well, I heard he was a good feller to work
for—thought I'd take on for a cow hand."</p>

<p>Pecos stated the proposition judicially, but
as he spoke he met the glowering glance of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
Crittenden with a cold and calculating eye.
The cattle-stealing war between John Upton
of Tonto Basin and Old Crit of Verde Crossing
was no secret in Arizona, though the
bloody Tewkesbury-Graham feud to the north
took away from its spectacular interest and reduced
it to the sordid level of commercialism.
It was, in fact, a contest as to which could hire
the nerviest cowboys and run off the most cattle,
and Pecos Dalhart knew this as well as Isaac
Crittenden. They stood and glared at each
other for a minute, therefore, and then Old
Crit broke loose.</p>

<p>"Whoever told you that John Upton is a
good feller is a liar!" he stormed, bringing
his fist down into his hand. "He's jest a common,
low-down cow-thief, as I've told him to
his face; and a man that will steal from his
friends will do anything. Now, young man,
before we go any farther I want to tell you
what kind of a reptile John Upton is. Him
and me run our cattle over in Tonto Basin for
years, and if we'd ever have any question
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
about a calf or a <i>orehanna</i> I'd always say,
'Well, take 'im, John,' jest like that, because I
didn't want to have no racket with a friend.
But they's some people, the more you give in
to 'em the more they run it over you, and they
come a day when I had to put my foot
down and say, 'No, that calf is mine,' and I
put my iron on 'im right there. Now that calf
was mine, you understand, and I branded him
IC on the ribs, in the corral and before witnesses,
accordin' to law, but about a week afterward
when I come across that critter, John
Upton had run a big U after my brand, makin'
it ICU. Well, you may laugh, but that's no
kind of a joke to play on a friend and I jest
hopped down off'n my horse and run a figger
2 after it, making it ICU2; and about the time
John Upton gits his funny ICU brand in the
book I goes down and registers ICU2, goin'
him one better. Now that's carryin' a joke
pretty far, and I admit it, but Upton wasn't
funnin'; that crooked-nose dastard had set out
to steal my cows from the start and, seein' I'd
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
euchered him on the ICU racket he went ahead
and slapped a big J in front of my IC iron, and
began branding my cows into what he called
his Jay-Eye-See brand. Well, that settled it.
I'm an honest man, but when a man steals
cows from me I don't know any way to break
even in this country but to steal back, and
while he was putting his J's on my IC critters
I jumped in and put IC2's on his U's until he
was ready to quit. He's <i>afraid</i> to burn my
brand now—he dassent do it—and so he's
beginnin' to squeal because I've got 'im in the
door; but say—" he beckoned with his head—"come
over here by the corral, I want to talk
to you."</p>

<p>Throughout this long tale of woe Pecos Dalhart
had shown but scant interest, having heard
it already, with variations, from Babe. According
to that faithless individual Old Crit
would steal fleas from a pet monkey and skin
them for the hide and tallow; his favorite pastime,
outside of cattle-rustling, being to take
on cowboys and then hold out their pay, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
rumor which caused Pecos Dalhart to regard
him warily.</p>

<p>"Now say," began the Boss of Verde Crossing,
as soon as they were out of hearing, "you
don't need to go to that hoss-thief Upton in
order to git a job. I'm always lookin' for the
right kind of man, myself. Have you had any
experience at this kind of thing?" He went
through the dexterous pantomime of burning
a brand through a blanket, but the cowboy only
turned away scornfully.</p>

<p>"If I had I'd never be dam' fool enough to
talk about it," he said.</p>

<p>"Oho!" observed Crit, rubbing the side of
his nose slyly, "you're travelling for your
health, are you?"</p>

<p>"No!" snarled the Texan. "The only people
that are lookin' for me are tryin' to keep
away from me, so you don't need to work that
auger any deeper. Now, Mr. Crittenden, I'm
a man of few words—what can I do for
you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>"We-ell," began the cowman, and once more
he paused to meditate.</p>

<p>"Since you inquire," continued the cowboy,
"I don't mind tellin' you that I'm travellin' for
excitement—and to grab some money. If
you've got any proposition that might appeal
to me, spit it out—if not, they's no harm
done."</p>

<p>"Well, wait a minute!" cried Old Crit, peevishly.</p>

<p>"My time's valuable," observed Pecos, sententiously.
"You can trust me as good as I
can trust you—mebby better. I don't hear
nobody accuse you of being sure pay, but if I
take your job I want you to remember that I
draw my money at the end of every month or
else I collect and quit. Now if you can jar
that proposition out of your system, I'll listen
to it."</p>

<p>"I guess you'll do," said the cowman, as if
quieting his own misgivings. "I've got a
little special work that I want done on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
quiet, markin' over some cows and calves. The
man that does it will have to hide out up in
that rough country and I'll pay him—forty
dollars."</p>

<p>"Eighty," said the Texan.</p>

<p>"W'y, I'm only payin' my round-up hands
thirty," protested Crittenden, weakly; "I'll
give you fifty, though."</p>

<p>"Eighty, cash," said the cowboy. "You'll
make that on the first ten calves."</p>

<p>"Sixty!" pleaded Crit.</p>

<p>"I want my money in my hand at the end of
every month," added Pecos, and then there was
a silence.</p>

<p>"All right," grumbled the cowman, at last,
"but you understand I expect something to
show for all that money. Now I want you to
go around the corner thar like you was mad, 'n'
saddle up and ride on, like you was goin' to
Upton's. Then when it comes night I want
you to ride back and camp out there by that
big ironwood over against the mesa. As soon
as me and the boys are out of sight in the mornin'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
my Mexican, Joe Garcia, will come out to
you with some grub and take you over to Carrizo
Springs, and I want you to <i>stay</i> there as
long as I keep driftin' U cows in over the
Peaks. Now look—here's your job—I
want you to burn every one of them Upton
cows over into a Wine-glass"—he made the
figure
<img src="images/i_033.jpg" alt="Brand in the shape of a wine-glass." />
in the sand—"and run it on the
calves. Savvy? Well, git, then, and remember
what I said about lookin' mad—I don't
want my punchers to git onto this!"</p>

<p class="ac">THE DOUBLE CROSS</p>

<p class="drop-cap">A MONTH passed, drearily; and while
Ike Crittenden and his punchers gathered
U cows on one side of the Four Peaks and
shoved them over the summit Pecos Dalhart
roped them as they came in to Carrizo Springs
for water and doctored over their brands. The
boys were following in the wake of Upton's
round-up and the brands on the calves were
freshly made and therefore easy to change, but
it called for all of Pecos's professional skill to
alter the cow brands to match. In order not
to cause adverse comment it is necessary that
the cow and calf shall show the same mark and
since the mother's brand was always old and
peeled Pecos called into requisition a square of
wet gunny-sack or blanket to help give the antique
effect. Spreading this over the old U he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
retraced the letter through it with a red-hot
iron and then extended the brand downward
until it formed a neat Wine-glass (<img src="images/i_033.jpg"
  alt="Brand in the shape of a wine-glass." />), scalded
rather than seared into the hair. Such a brand
would never look fresh or peel, though it might
grow dim with years, and after working the
ear-marks over on cow and calf the transformation
was complete. But while the results of
his labor was a fine little bunch of Wine-glass
cows hanging around Carrizo Springs, to
Pecos himself, tying a knot in a buckskin
string to count off each weary day, the month
seemed interminable.</p>

<p>There was a sound of music in the store as
he rode into Verde Crossing and he spurred
forward, eager for the sight of a human face
and a chance to sit down and talk. But at the
thud of hoofs and the chink of spurs Angevine
Thorne brought his song to an untimely close
and, as Pecos dismounted, Marcelina Garcia
slipped out through the door and started towards
home, favoring him in passing with a
haughty stare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good-morning, Mex!" he exclaimed, bowing
and touching his heart in an excess of gallantry,
"fine large day, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"<i>Gringo!</i>" shrilled Marcelina, flaunting her
dark hair, "<i>Pendejo Texano!</i> Ahhr!" She
shuddered and thrust out her tongue defiantly,
but as the "fool Texan" only laughed and clattered
into the store she paused and edged back
towards the door for further observations.</p>

<p>"W'y, hello, Angy!" cried Pecos, racking
jovially up to the bar, "how's the champeen?
Sober as a judge, hey? Well, gimme another
shot of that snake-pisen and if it don't kill me
I may swear off too, jest to be sociable! Say,
what does 'pen<i>day</i>ho' mean?" He glanced
roguishly back towards the door, where he
knew Marcelina was listening, and laughed
when he got the translation.</p>

<p>"Dam' fool, hey? Well, I thought it was
something like that—kinder p'lite and lady-like,
you know. Marcelina hung that on me
as I come in, but I called her a Mex and I'll
stand by it. Where's Old Crit?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>Angevine Thorne drew himself up and regarded
the cowboy with grave displeasure.</p>

<p>"Mr. Crittenden is out riding," he said, "and
I'll thank you not to refer to the nativity of
my friend, Miss Garcia."</p>

<p>"Certainly not—to be sure!" protested
Pecos Dalhart. "If you will jest kindly give
me an introduction to the young lady I'll—"</p>

<p>"See you in hell first," broke in Angy, with
asperity. "Where you been all the time?"</p>

<p>"Ramblin' around, ramblin' around," answered
Pecos, waving his hand vaguely.
"What's the chances for a little music and song
to while the time away? I'm lonely as a dog."</p>

<p>"Joe Garcia tells me he's been packin' grub
out to you at Carrizo—what you been doin' in
that God-forsaken hole?"</p>

<p>"Yore friend Joe talks too much," observed
Pecos, briefly, "and I reckon <i>you</i> tell everything
you know, don't you? Well and good,
then, I'll keep you out of trouble with the Boss
by listenin' to what you know already. Can
you sing the 'Ranger,' or 'California Joe'?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
No? Can't even sing 'Kansas,' can you?
Well, it's too bad about you, but I'm going
to show you that they's another canary bird
on the Verde, and he can sure sing." With
this declaration Pecos leaned back against the
bar, squared his shoulders, and in a voice which
had many a time carolled to a thousand head
of cattle burst into a boastful song.</p>

<p>A dark mass of hair shading a pair of eyes
as black and inquisitive as a chipmunk's appeared
suddenly in the vacant square of the
doorway and instantly the bold cowboy stopped
his song.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Miss Garcia," he said, bowing
low, "won't you come in—now, Angy, do
your duty or I'll beat you to death!" At this
hasty aside Angevine Thorne did the honors,
though with a bad grace.</p>

<p>"Marcelina, this is Mr. Dalhart—you
better go home now, your mother's callin'
you."</p>

<p>"I will not shake hands with a <i>Texano</i>!" pronounced
Marcelina, stepping into the open and
folding her arms disdainfully.</p>

<p>"Come on in then and hear the music," suggested
Pecos, peaceably.</p>

<p>"Pah! The <i>Tehannos</i> sing like coyotes!"
cried Marcelina, twisting up her lips in derision.
"They are bad, bad men—<i>mi madre</i>
say so. No, I go home—and when you are
gone Babe will sing <i>sweet</i> moosic for me." She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
bowed, with a little smile for Babe, and glided
through the doorway; and though he lingered
about until Old Crit came in, Pecos Dalhart
failed to catch another glimpse of this new
queen of his heart.</p>

<p>It was dusk when Crittenden rode into camp,
and at sight of Pecos Dalhart sitting by the
fire the cowman's drawn face, pinched by hunger
and hard riding, puckered up into a knot.</p>

<p>"What you doin' down here?" he demanded,
when he had beckoned him to one side.</p>

<p>"Come down for my pay," responded the
cowboy, briefly.</p>

<p>"Your pay," fumed Crittenden, "your pay!
What do you need with money up at Carrizo?
Say, have you been gittin' many?" he whispered,
eagerly. "Have they been comin' in on
you?"</p>

<p>"Sure thing. Branded forty-two cows,
thirty calves, and sixteen twos. But how
about it—do I draw?"</p>

<p>"Only thirty calves! W'y, what in the world
have you been doin'? I could pick up that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
many mavericks on the open range. You
must've been layin' down under a tree!"</p>

<p>"That's right," agreed Pecos, "and talkin'
to myse'f, I was that lonely. But if you'll
kindly fork over that eighty that's comin' to me
we'll call it square, all the same—I only
branded about a thousand dollars' worth of
cows for you."</p>

<p>"Eighty dollars!" cried Old Crit. "W'y, I
never agreed to nothin' like that—I said I'd
give you sixty. But I'll tell you what I'll
do," he added, quickly, "I'll make it eighty if
you'll go up there for another month."</p>

<p>"After I git my first month's pay they will
be time to discuss that," replied Pecos Dalhart,
and after a thousand protestations the cowman
finally went down into his overalls and produced
the money.</p>

<p>"Now what about next month?" he demanded,
sharply.</p>

<p>"Nope," said Pecos, pocketing his eighty
dollars, "too lonely—too much trouble collectin'
my pay—don't like the job."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>"Give you eighty dollars," urged Crit,
"that's a heap o' money for one month."</p>

<p>"Nope, this'll last me a while—so long."
He started toward the corral but Crittenden
caught him by the arm instantly.</p>

<p>"Here, wait a minute," he rasped, "what's
the matter with you anyhow? I'm ridin' early
and late on my round-up and dependin' on you
to finish this job up! You ain't goin' to quit
me right in the middle of it, are you?"</p>

<p>"That's what," returned Pecos. "I ain't so
particular about brandin' a maverick once in a
while—every cowman does that—but this
idee of stealin' from a man you never saw goes
agin' me. I git to thinkin' about it, an' it ain't
right!"</p>

<p>"Aw, sho, sho, boy," protested Crittenden,
"you don't want to mind a little thing like that—I
thought you was a man with nerve. Now
here, I can't stop to go out there now and I
want to git that work finished up—I'll give
you <i>eight-y-five dol-lars</i> to stay another month!
This man Upton is the biggest cow-thief in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
country," he went on, as Pecos shook his head,
"it ain't stealin' to rob a thief, is it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, ain't it?" inquired the cow-puncher,
gravely, and he smiled grimly to himself as
Crittenden endeavored to set his mind at rest.
"All right then," he said, cutting short the cowman's
labored justification of cattle-rustling,
"I'll go you—for a hundred."</p>

<p>"A hundred!" repeated Crittenden, aghast.
"Well, for—all right, all right," he cried, as
Pecos moved impatiently away. "Now you
pull out of here the way you did before and I'll
have Joe pack you over some more grub. A
hundred dollars," he murmured, shaking his
head at the thought, "that boy will ruin me."</p>

<p>Early the next morning Pecos Dalhart rode
slowly up the trail that led to Carrizo Springs
and the deserted country beyond, a land where
as yet the cowmen had not extended their sway.
To his left rose the sharp granite spires of the
Four Peaks, to the right gleamed the silvery
thread of the Salagua, that mighty river that
flowed in from the east; and all the country between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
was a jumble of cliffs and buttes and
ridges and black cañons, leading from the
mountains to the river.</p>

<p>"So it ain't no crime to rob a thief, hey?" he
muttered, when, topping the last ridge, he
gazed down at Carrizo Springs and across at
the white-worn trail which led into the wilderness
beyond. "Well, if that's the case I might
as well search out that country over there and
git busy on Old Crit. A man's a dam' fool to
steal a thousand dollars' worth of cattle and
only git eighty dollars for it."</p>

<p>Three days later, riding by a trail that led
ever to the east, Pecos came upon a narrow valley
filled with cottonwoods and wild walnuts
and echoing to the music of running water. A
fine brook, flowing down from the brushy
heights of the Peaks, leaped and tumbled over
the bowlders and disappeared through a narrow
cleft below, where the two black walls drew
together until they seemed almost to block
the cañon. As Pecos rode cautiously down the
creek-bed he jumped a bunch of cattle from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
the shade of the alders and, spurring after them
as they shambled off, he saw that they bore the
familiar U, even to the young calves. Undoubtedly
they belonged to the same bunch
that he had been working on over at Carrizo
Springs—the fresh-branded calves and U
cows that Crittenden was shoving over the
Peaks. Riding farther down the gulch Pecos
came upon a cave at the base of the overhanging
cliff. In time past the Indians had camped
there, but the ashes of their fires were bedded
and only their crude pictures on the smoke-grimed
rocks remained to tell the tale. It was
the cave of Lost Dog Cañon.</p>

<p>On their trip over the simple-minded José
had spoken of a lost cañon somewhere over in
the mountains but Pecos had never dreamed
of finding a paradise like this. According to
José the Cañon of Perro Perdito was haunted
by a spirit which was <i>muy malo</i>, throwing down
great rocks from the sides of the cañon and
howling like a lost dog at night, but in the
broad light of noonday Pecos was undaunted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
and he rode on into the tunnel-like box cañon
until it pinched down to a mere cleft. It was
an eerie place, but there never was a ghost yet
that threw a track like a cow and, led on by
their familiar foot-prints among the rocks,
Pecos forged ahead until he stepped out suddenly
into a new world. Behind him the pent
and overhanging walls shut out the light of
day but here the sun was shining into a deep
valley where in exquisite miniature lay parks
and grassy meadows, while cathedral spires of
limestone, rising from the cañon floor, joined
their mighty flanks to the rim-rock which shut
the whole space in. The glittering waters of
the Salagua, far below, marked a natural barrier
to the south and as Pecos Dalhart looked
at the narrow trail which had brought him in he
began instinctively to figure on a drift fence,
to close the entrance to the pocket, and make
the hidden valley a mile-wide pasture and corral.
All nature seemed conspiring to make
him a cattle-rustler and this hidden pasture,
with its grass and water and the gate opening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
at his very door, cast the die. Two days later
he moved his camp to Lost Dog Cañon and flew
at the fence with feverish energy. Within a
week he had the box cañon barricaded from wall
to wall and then, as the U cows came down to
the creek to drink, he roped them, worked over
their brands, and threw them into his new pasture.
By this time, with his tongue in his
cheek, he attached a circle instead of a bar to
the U and named his new brand the Monkey-wrench
(<img src="images/i_045.jpg"
        alt="Brand in the shape of a monkey-wrench" />).
If he had any qualms as to
the morality of this last act Pecos did not let
them interfere with his industry in any way.
The ethics of the cattle business will not stand
too stern a scrutiny, even at this late date, and
the joke on Old Crit was so primordial in its
duplicity that it obscured the finer moral issues.
Like many another cowman of those early days
Pecos Dalhart had made his start with the running
iron and with luck and judgment he
might yet be a cattle king.</p>

<div class="chapter">
   <h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>

<p class="ac">THE SHOW-DOWN</p>

<p class="drop-cap">IT is a great sensation to feel that you are a
prospective cattle king, but somehow when
Pecos Dalhart rode back to Verde Crossing his
accustomed gaiety had fled. There were no
bows and smiles for Marcelina, no wordy exchanges
with the garrulous Babe—there is a
difference, after all, between stealing cows for
eighty dollars a month and stealing for yourself,
and while a moralist might fail to see the
distinction it showed in its effect on Pecos's
spirits.</p>

<p>"I'm goin' down to Geronimo," he grumbled,
after an uneasy hour at the store, during
which he had tried in vain the cheering power
of whiskey; "you can tell Crit I'll be back to-morrow
night for my time," and without volunteering
any further information he rode
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
down to the river, plunged across the rocky
ford and was swallowed up in the desert. Two
days later he returned, red-eyed and taciturn,
and to all Babe's inquiries he observed that the
Geronimo saloons were the worst deadfalls
west of the Rio Grande, for a certainty. His
mood did not improve by waiting, and when
Crittenden finally rode in after his long day's
work he demanded his money so brusquely that
even that old-timer was startled.</p>

<p>"Well, sho, sho, boy," he soothed, "don't git
excited over nothin'! To be sure I'll pay you
your money." He went down into his overalls
with commendable promptitude, but Pecos only
watched him in surly silence. Something in his
pose seemed to impress the shifty cowman; he
drew forth a roll of bills and began to count
them out, reluctantly. "Twenty, forty, sixty,
eighty, a hundred—there it is—now what's
all this racket about?"</p>

<p>"Nothin'," responded Pecos, stowing away
the greenbacks, "but you can git somebody else
to finish up that job."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, here," snapped the cowman, warming
up a little as Dalhart cooled down, "don't
I git no accountin' for this month's work?
How many did you brand and what you
quittin' for?"</p>

<p>"I branded sixty-seven cows, fifty-five
calves, and thirty two-year-olds," replied the
cowboy, boldly, and Crittenden, not knowing
in what iron they were branded, chuckled
gleefully.</p>

<p>"Umm," he murmured, "wall, say now, that
ain't so bad. Old Upton will make a buck-jump
at the moon when he finds this out. But
lookee here, boy, I'm goin' to be driftin' cows
into that country for another month yet, and
that'll be as long as we can brand and ear-mark
on account of the flies in June. Now I want
to make a dicker with you for jest one more
month and I'll be generous with you—how
about a hundred and ten—that's pretty nigh
four months' wages for a cow-punch!"</p>

<p>"No, I've done quit!" protested Pecos, vigorously.
"Steal your own cattle! When I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
want to go into the rustlin' business I'll rustle
for myse'f!"</p>

<p>"Jest one more month," insisted Old Crit,
"I'll give you a hundred and twenty!"</p>

<p>The cowboy looked at him a minute and
smiled sneeringly. "Well, bein' as yore money
seems to be burnin' a hole in yore pocket," he
said, "I guess I'll have to take it away from
you, but I'll tell you right now I don't approve
of this cow-stealin'—it's likely to git a
man into trouble!"</p>

<p>"All right, all right," said Crittenden, making
haste to clinch the bargain, "a hundred and
twenty, then; and they hain't nobody ever been
convicted in Geronimo County yet for stealin'
cows, so you don't need to worry none. Pull
your freight, now, and I'll be over later on to
see what you've done."</p>

<p>As Pecos Dalhart and José Garcia rode up
the Carrizo trail the next morning driving their
pack animals before them, the conversation
was chiefly between José and his mules. Pecos
did not approve of Mexicans and José did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
approve of Pecos—he had been making love
to his girl, Marcelina. But about a mile out
of Verde Crossing they came across an object
that was worthy of comment—an old cow and
her calf, both so curiously marked that no cowboy
could pass them unnoticed. The cow was
covered from shoulder to flank with minute red
and white spots and, plastered generously
across her face, was a variegated blotch of the
creamy dun color peculiar to Chihuahua stock.
The calf was like its mother, even to the dun
face and spotted neck and ears, but she, on account
of her brand and ear-marks, held the
entire attention of the Texan.</p>

<p>"What brand you call that, Joe?" he inquired,
as the old cow contemplated them from
the hillside.</p>

<p>"<i>Mi fiero!</i>" exclaimed the Mexican, proudly
tapping himself on the chest.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's yourn, is it?" commented Pecos.
"Looks like an Injun arrer struck by lightnin',
don't it? Well, these Mexican irons are too
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
many for me—I see you got winders in her
ears!"</p>

<p>"You bet," assented Joe, "that my mark, un
<i>ventano</i>, un slash, un <i>anzuelo</i>!"</p>

<p>"A window, a slash, and an underbit, hey—you
don't figure on anybody stealin' <i>her</i>, unless
they cut 'er ears off, do you? How many cows
you got?"</p>

<p>"Oh, six—eight," answered José, pride of
possession loosening up his tongue, "this good
milk cow."</p>

<p>"Milk cow, eh?" repeated Pecos, and then he
stopped and pondered a while. Only the day
before he had recorded his Monkey-wrench
brand at Geronimo, although he did not have
an honestly acquired cow in the world—here
was a chance to cover his hand. "How much
you take for cow, Joe?" he asked. "I like
milk, my camp."</p>

<p>"You take calf too?" inquired the Mexican,
shrewdly.</p>

<p>"Sure," said Pecos, "give you twenty dollars
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
for the cow and ten for the calf!" He drew a
roll of bills from his pocket and began to peel
them off temptingly.</p>

<p>"You geev twenty-five for cow," suggested
Joe, his slow wits beginning to move at the sight
of real money.</p>

<p>"All right," said Pecos, briskly, "I'll give
you twenty-five for the cow and five for the
calf—but you have to give me bill of sale."</p>

<p>"<i>Stawano</i>," assented the Mexican, "and I
vent her when we geet to camp, too. Dam' Ol'
Crit," he observed, as he pocketed the money,
"I work for heem long time—he make me
take trade een store—all time in debt!"</p>

<p>He threw the spotted cow and calf in with
the pack animals and when they had arrived
at Carrizo Springs he roped her and, true to
his promise, ran his Indian arrow brand on her
shoulder, thus making her a living document
and memorandum of sale. In the cow country
that "vent" on the shoulder is the only bill of
sale required, but Pecos drew up a formal paper
giving the ear-marks and brand, and after Joe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
had signed it and gone he roped Old Funny-face
again and ran a Monkey-wrench on her
ribs beneath the original mark, all of which is
strictly according to law. After that he herded
her close, letting the little Monkey-wrench calf
have all the milk, while he waited expectantly
for Old Crit to drop in.</p>

<p>At the beginning of his long month of waiting
Pecos Dalhart was watchful and conservative.
He branded up all the cattle that had
drifted into Lost Dog Cañon, drove them
down into his hidden pasture and closed the
breach in his drift fence—then he moved back
to Carrizo and went soberly about his work.
Old Funny-face and her spotted calf were the
only Monkey-wrench cows at Carrizo Springs
and though he held a bill of sale for them
Pecos was finally compelled to drive them over
the trail to his Lost Dog pasture in order to
keep them from sneaking back home to Verde
Crossing and tipping his hand prematurely to
Isaac Crittenden. He was a hard man, Old
Crit, especially when his pocket-book was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
touched, and Pecos looked for a gunplay when
the Boss finally found him out; but if Crittenden
got wind of his duplicity in advance he
might come over with all his Texas cowboys
and wipe Mr. Pecos Dalhart off the map. So
at the start he was careful, running nothing
but Wine-glasses on the U cows that still came
drifting in over the mountains, but as the days
went by and his courage mounted up against
the time when he was to face Old Crit a spirit
of bravado crept in on him and made him over-bold.
All he wanted now was a show-down,
and he wanted it quick—one Monkey-wrench
brand would tell the story. With a sardonic
grin Pecos put his rope on a likely young maverick
and burned a Monkey-wrench on his ribs;
then, in order that there should be no mistake,
he worked over the brand on a U cow and put
his iron on the calf. As the last days of the
month dragged by and the fighting spirit
within him clamored for action he threw caution
to the winds, running a Monkey-wrench on
every cow-brute he caught.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>For weeks Pecos had watched the brow of
the hill where the Verde trail came in, and he
wore his six-shooter constantly, even at his
branding, but when at last Crittenden finally
rode in on him he was so intent about his work
that he almost overlooked him. Only the
fidgeting of his horse, which was holding the
rope taut on a big U cow that he had strung
out, saved him from being surprised at his
task and taken at a disadvantage. One glance
was enough—it was Crit, and he was alone.
Pecos stood up and looked at him as he came
slowly down the hill—then, as the cow struggled
to get up, he seized his running iron
from the fire, spread a wet sack over her brand,
and burned a big Monkey-wrench through the
steaming cloth.</p>

<p>"Hello!" hailed the cowman, spurring
eagerly in on him. "Are you catchin' many?"</p>

<p>"Oodles of 'em!" answered Pecos, loosening
his tie-down strings and swinging up on
his horse. "Git up there, cow, and show
yourse'f off to the Boss!" He slackened the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
taut reata that was fastened around her hind
feet and as the old cow sprang up, shaking off
the sack, the smoking Monkey-wrench on her
ribs stood out like hand-writing on the wall.</p>

<p>"Wh-what's that?" gasped Crit, staring at
the mark. "I thought I told you to run a
Wine-glass!"</p>

<p>"That's right," assented Pecos, dropping
his hand to his hip, "but I got tired of runnin'
your old brand, so I studied out a little improvement!"</p>

<p>He laughed hectoringly as he spoke and the
realization of the fraud that had been perpetrated
upon him made Crittenden reel in the
saddle.</p>

<p>"Hev—hev you recorded that brand?" he
demanded, tensely.</p>

<p>"I certainly have," responded Pecos, "and
I didn't see no Wine-glass registered before
me, neither. If I'd been real foxy, like some
people I know, I would've put that in the book
too and euchered you out of the whole bunch.
But I'm good-natured, Mr. Crittenden, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
bein' as I was takin' your money I branded
most of these U cows in the Wine-glass. I
hope you'll be able to take this reasonable."</p>

<p>"Reasonable!" screamed Crittenden, "reasonable!
W'y, if I wasn't the most reasonable
man on earth I'd shoot you so full of
lead it'd take a wagon to haul you to the graveyard.
But you don't know who you're up
against, boy, if you think you can fool me like
this—the man don't live that can give Ike
Crittenden the double cross. I been in the
business too long. Now I give you jest five
minutes to make me out a bill of sale for your
entire brand, whatever you call it. Ef you
<i>don't</i>—"</p>

<p>He rose up threateningly in his stirrups and
his one good eye glared balefully, but Pecos
had been expecting something like this for a
month or more and he did not weaken.</p>

<p>"Go ahead," he said, "my brand is the
Monkey-wrench; I come by it as honest as you
come by the Wine-glass, and I'll fight for it.
If you crowd me too hard, I'll shoot; and if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
you try to run me out of the country I'll give
the whole snap away to Upton."</p>

<p>"W'y, you son of a—" began the cowman
malignantly, but he did not specify. Pecos's
ever-ready pistol was out and balanced in his
hand.</p>

  <div class="caption">Pecos's ever-ready pistol was out and balanced in his hand</div>
</div>

<p>"That'll do, Mr. Crittenden," he said, edging
his horse in closer. "I never took that off
o' nobody yet, and 'tain't likely I'll begin with
you. If you're lookin' for trouble you'll find
I can accommodate you, any time—but listen
to reason, now. This ain't the first time a
cowman has got himse'f into trouble by hirin'
somebody else to do his stealin' for him—I've
been around some, and I know. But they
ain't no use of us fightin' each other—we're
both in the same line of business. You leave
me alone and I'll keep shut about this—is
it a go?"</p>

<p>The fires of inextinguishable hate were burning
in Old Crit's eye and his jaw trembled as
he tried to talk.</p>

<p>"Young man," he began, wagging a warning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
finger at his enemy, "young man—" He
paused and cursed to himself fervently. "How
much will you take for your brand?" he cried,
trying to curb his wrath, "and agree to quit
the country?"</p>

<p>"I ain't that kind of a hold-up," replied
Pecos, promptly. "I like this country and
I'm goin' to live here. They's two or three
hundred head of cattle running in here that
I branded for you for a hundred and eighty
dollars. They're worth two or three thousand.
I've got a little bunch myself that I
picked up on the side, when I wasn't stealin'
for you. Now all I ask is to be left alone, and
I'll do the same by you. Is it a go?"</p>

<p>The cold light of reason came into Crittenden's
fiery orb and glittered like the hard
finish of an agate.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, grudgingly, "well—oh
hell, yes!" He urged his horse sullenly up the
hill. "Another one of them smart Texicans,"
he muttered, "but I'll cure him of suckin' eggs
before I'm through with 'im."</p>

</div>

<p class="ac">LOST DOG CAÑON</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE silence of absolute loneliness lay upon
Lost Dog Cañon like a pall and to
Pecos Dalhart, sprawling in the door of his
cave, it seemed as if mysterious voices were
murmuring to each other behind the hollow
gurgling of the creek. From far down the
cañon the bawling of cows, chafing against
the drift fence, echoed with dreary persistence
among the cliffs, and the deep subterranean
rumbling which gave the place its bad name
broke in upon his meditations like the stirring
of some uneasy devil confined below. On the
rim of the black cañon wall that rose against
him a flock of buzzards sat in a tawdry row,
preening their rusty feathers or hopping
awkwardly about in petty, ineffectual quarrels—as
shabby a set of loafers as ever basked
in the sun. For a week Pecos had idled about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
his cave, now building pole houses to protect
his provisions from the rats, now going out to
the point to watch the Verde trail, until the
emptiness of it had maddened him. At first
he had looked for trouble—the veiled treachery
of some gun-man, happening in on him accidentally,
or an armed attack from Old Crit's
cowboys—but now he would welcome the appearance
of Crit himself. In action Pecos
could trust his nerves absolutely, but he chafed
at delay like a spirited horse that frets constantly
at the bit. If it was to be a game of
waiting Crittenden had won already. Pecos
threw away his cigarette impatiently and hurried
down the cañon to catch his horse.</p>

<p>"Where's Old Crit?" he demanded when,
after a long ride, he stalked defiantly into the
store at Verde Crossing.</p>

<p>"Damfino," replied Babe, looking up from
a newspaper he was reading, "gone down to
Geronimo, I guess."</p>

<p>"Is he lookin' for me?" inquired Pecos,
guardedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>"W'y, not so's you notice it," answered the
bar-keeper, easily. "It'd be the first case on
record, I reckon, bein' as he owes you money.
In fact, until you collect your last month's pay
the chances are good that you'll be lookin' for
him. Did you see the new sign over the door?"</p>

<p>"No," said Pecos, "what is it?"</p>

<p>"Post Office!" replied Babe, proudly.
"Yes, sir, Old Good Eye has certainly knocked
the persimmon this time and put Verde Crossing
on the map. They's lots of ranchers up
and down the river—and you, of course, over
there at Carrizo—and Crit figured it out
some time ago that if he could git 'em to come
here for their mail he'd catch their trade in
whiskey; so what does he do but apply to the
Post Office Department for a mail route from
here to Geronimo and bid in the contract himself!
Has to send Joe down about once a
week, anyhow, you understand, and he might
as well git the Government to pay for it. So
you can write home to your folks now to send
your mail to Verde Crossing—tell your girl
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
too, because if we don't git ten letters a week
we lose our route."</p>

<p>Pecos twisted uneasily on his chair. Like
many another good Texan he was not writing
home.</p>

<p>"Ain't got no girl," he protested, blushing
beneath his tan.</p>

<p>"No?" said Angy, "well that's good news
for Marcelina—she was inquirin' about you
the other day. But say, here's some advertisements
in this paper that might interest you.
Umm—lemme see, now—'Genuine Diamonds,
rings, earrings, and brooches, dollar
forty-eight a piece, to introduce our new line.'
That's pretty cheap, ain't it! 'Always acceptable
to a lady,' it says. Yes, if you don't
want 'em yourself you can give 'em away, see?
You know, I'm tryin' to git the fellers around
here interested, so's they'll write more letters."</p>

<p>He threw this out for a feeler and Pecos
responded nobly. "Well, go ahead and order
me them rings and earrings," he said, "I'm no
cheap sport. What else you got that's good?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>Angevine Thorne dropped his paper and
reached stealthily for a large mail-order catalogue
on the counter. "Aprons, bath-tubs,
curtains, dishes," he read, running his finger
down the index. "Here's some silk handkerchiefs
that might suit you; 'green, red, blue,
and yaller, sixty cents each; with embroidered
initials, twenty cents extra.'"</p>

<p>"I'll go you!" cried the cowboy, looking
over his shoulder. "Gimme half a dozen of
them red ones—no squaw colors for me—and
say, lemme look at them aprons."</p>

<p>"Aprons!" yelled Angy. "Well—what—the—"</p>

<p>"Aw, shut up!" snarled Pecos, blushing
furiously. "Can't you take a joke? Here,
gimme that catalogue—you ain't the only
man on the Verde that can read and write—I've
had some schoolin' myself!"</p>

<p>He retired to a dark corner with the "poor
man's enemy" and pored over it laboriously,
scrawling from time to time upon an order
blank which Angy had thoughtfully provided.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
At last the deed was done, all but adding up
the total, and after an abortive try or two the
cowboy slipped in a twenty-dollar bill and
wrote: "Giv me the rest in blue hankerchefs
branded M." Then he sealed and directed the
letter and called on Babe for a drink.</p>

<p>"How long before I'll git them things?" he
inquired, his mind still heated with visions of
aprons, jewelry, and blue handkerchiefs,
branded M,—"two or three weeks? Well, I'll
be down before then—they might come
sooner. Where's all the punchers?"</p>

<p>"Oh, they're down in Geronimo, gettin'
drunk. Round-up's over, now, and Crit laid
'em off. Gittin' kinder lonely around here."</p>

<p>"Lonely!" echoed Pecos. "Well, if you call
this lonely you ought to be out in Lost Dog
Cañon, where I am. They's nothin' stirrin'
there but the turkey-buzzards—I'm gittin'
the willies already, jest from listenin' to myself
think. Say, come on out and see me sometime,
can't you?"</p>

<p>"Nope," said Babe, "if you knew all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
things that Crit expects me to do in a day
you'd wonder how I git time to shave. But
say, what you doin' out there, if it's a fair
question?"</p>

<p>"Who—me? Oh, I've made me a little
camp over in that cave and I'm catchin' them
wild cattle that ooze along the creek." He
tried to make it as matter-of-fact as possible,
but Angevine Thorne knew better.</p>

<p>"Yes, I've heard of them wild cows," he
drawled, slowly closing one eye, "the boys've
been driftin' 'em over the Peaks for two
months. Funny how they was all born with a
U on the ribs, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"Sure, but they's always some things you
can't explain in a cow country," observed
Pecos, philosophically. "Did Crit tell you
anything about his new iron? No? Called
the Wine-glass—in the brand book by this
time, I reckon."</p>

<p>"Aha! I see—I see!" nodded Angy.
"Well, Old Good Eye wants to go easy on this
moonlightin'—we've got a new sheriff down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
here in Geronimo now—Boone Morgan—and
he was elected to put the fear of God into
the hearts of these cowmen and make 'em
respect the law. W'y, Crit won't even pay
his taxes, he's that ornery. When the Geronimo
tax-collector shows up he says his cows
all run over in Tonto County; and when the
Tonto man finally made a long trip down here
Crit told <i>him</i> his cows all ran in Geronimo
County, all but a hundred head or so, and John
Upton had stole them. The tax-collectors
have practically give up tryin' to do anything
up here in the mountains—the mileage of the
assessor and collector eats up all the profits
to the county, and it's easier to turn these
cowmen loose than it is to follow 'em up. This
here Geronimo man jumped all over Crit
last time he was up here, but Crit just
laughed at him. 'Well,' he says, 'if you
don't like the figgers I give, you better
go out on the range and count them cows
yourself, you're so smart.' And what could
the poor man do? It'd cost more to round
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
up Old Crit's cattle than the taxes would
come to in a lifetime. But you want to
look out, boy," continued Angy earnestly,
"how you monkey around with them U cattle—Boone
Morgan is an old-timer in these parts
and he's likely to come over the hill some day
and catch you in the act."</p>

<p>"Old Crit says they never was a man sent
up in this county yet for stealin' cattle," ventured
Pecos, lamely.</p>

<p>"Sure not," assented Angevine Thorne,
"but they's been a whole lot of 'em killed for
it! I don't suppose he mentioned that. Have
you heard about this Tewkesbury-Graham war
that's goin' on up in Pleasant Valley? That
all started over rustlin' cattle, and they's over
sixty men killed already and everybody hidin'
out like thieves. A couple of Crit's bad
punchers came down through there from the
Hash-knife and they said it was too crude for
them—everybody fightin' from ambush and
killin' men, women, and children. I tell you,
it's got the country stirred up turrible—that's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
how come Boone Morgan was elected
sheriff. The people down in Geronimo figured
out if they didn't stop this stealin' and rustlin'
and alterin' brands pretty soon, Old Crit and
Upton would lock horns—or some of these
other cowmen up here in the mountains—and
the county would go bankrupt like Tonto
is, with sheriff's fees and murder trials. No,
sir, they ain't been enough law up here on the
Verde to intimidate a jackrabbit so far—it's
all down there in Geronimo, where they give
me that life sentence for conspicuous drunkenness—but
you want to keep your ear to the
ground, boy, because you're goin' to hear
something drap!"</p>

<p>"What d'ye think's goin' to happen, Babe?"
asked the cowboy, uneasily. "Old Crit can't
be scared very bad—he's laid off all his
punchers."</p>

<p>"Huh! you don't know Crit as well as I do,"
commented Babe. "Don't you know those
punchers would've quit anyhow, as soon as
they got their pay? He does that every year
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
—lays 'em off and then goes down to Geronimo
about the time they're broke, and half of
'em in jail, mebby, and bails 'em out. He'll
have four or five of 'em around here all summer,
workin' for nothin' until the fall round-up
comes off. I tell you, that man'll skin a flea
anytime for the hide and taller. You want
to keep out of debt to him or he'll make you
into a Mexican peon, like Joe Garcia over
here. Joe's been his corral boss and teamster
for four years now and I guess they's a hundred
dollars against him on the books, right
now. Will drink a little whiskey once in
a while, you know, like all the rest of us, and
the Señora keeps sendin' over for sugar and
coffee and grub, and somehow or other, Joe
is always payin' for a dead horse. Wouldn't
be a Mexican, though," observed Babe, philosophically,
"if he wasn't in debt to the store.
A Mexican ain't happy until he's in the hole
a hundred or so—then he can lay back and
sojer on his job and the boss is afraid to fire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
'im. There's no use of his havin' anything,
anyhow—his relatives would eat 'im out of
house and home in a minute. There was a
Mexican down the river here won the grand
prize in a lottery and his relatives come overland
from as far as Sonora to help him spend
the money. Inside of a month he was drivin'
a wood-wagon again in order to git up a little
grub. He was a big man while it lasted—open
house day and night, <i>fiestas</i> and <i>bailes</i>
and a string band to accompany him wherever
he went—but when it was all over old Juan
couldn't buy a pint of whiskey on credit if
he was snake-bit. They're a great people, for
sure."</p>

<p>"That's right," assented Pecos, absently,
"but say, I reckon I'll be goin'." The social
qualities of the Spanish-Americans did not interest
him just then—he was thinking about
Boone Morgan. "Gimme a dollar's worth of
smoking tobacco and a box of forty-fives and
I'll hit the road."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>"There's one thing more you forgot," suggested
Angevine Thorne, as he wrapped up
the purchases.</p>

<p>"What—Marcelina?" ventured Pecos,
faintly.</p>

<p>"Naw—your <i>mail</i>!" cried Angy, scornfully,
and dipping down into a cracker box he
brought out a paper on the yellow wrapper of
which was printed "Pecos Dalhart, Verde
Crossing, Ariz."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> never subscribed for no paper!" protested
Pecos, turning it over suspiciously.
"Here—I don't want it."</p>

<p>"Ump-umm," grunted Angy, smiling mysteriously,
"take it along. All the boys git
one. You can read it out in camp. Well, if
you're goin' to be bull-headed about it I'll
tell you. Crit subscribed for it for every man
in Verde—only cost two-bits a year. Got to
build up this mail route somehow, you know.
It's called the <i>Voice of Reason</i> and it's against
the capitalistic classes."</p>

<p>"The which?" inquired Pecos, patiently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Aw, against rich fellers—these sharks like
Old Crit that's crushin' the life outer the common
people. That's the paper I was showin'
you—where they was advertisin' diamonds for
a dollar forty-eight a piece."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Pecos, thrusting it into his chaps,
"why didn't you say so before? Sure, I'll
read it!"</p>

   <h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>

<p class="ac">"THE VOICE OF REASON"</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE fierce heat of summer fell suddenly
upon Lost Dog Cañon and all the
Verde country—the prolonged heat which
hatches flies by the million and puts an end to
ear-marking and branding. Until the cool
weather of October laid them and made it possible
to heal a wound there was nothing for
Pecos to do but doctor a few sore ears and read
the <i>Voice of Reason</i>. Although he had spent
most of his life in the saddle the school-teacher
back on the Pecos had managed to corral him
long enough to beat the three R's into him and,
being still young, he had not yet had time
to forget them. Only twenty summers had
passed over his head, so far, and he was a man
only in stature and the hard experience of his
craft. He was a good Texan—born a Democrat
and taught to love whiskey and hate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
Mexicans—but so far his mind was guiltless
of social theory. That there was something
in the world that kept a poor man down he
knew, vaguely; but never, until the <i>Voice of
Reason</i> brought it to his attention, had he
heard of the conspiracy of wealth or the crime
of government. Not until, sprawling at the
door of his cave, he mumbled over the full-mouthed
invective of that periodical had he
realized what a poor, puny creature a wage-slave
really was, and when he read of the
legalized robbery which went on under the
name of law his young blood boiled in revolt.
The suppression of strikes by Pinkertons, the
calling out of the State Militia to shoot
down citizens, the blacklisting of miners, and
the general oppression of workingmen was all
far away and academic to him—the thing that
gripped and held him was an article on the
fee system, under which officers of the law arrest
all transient citizens who are unfortunate
enough to be poor, and judges condemn them
in order to gain a fee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Think, Slave, Think!</i>" it began. "You
may be the next innocent man to be thrown
into some vile and vermin-infested county-jail
to swell the income of the bloated minions who
fatten upon the misery of the poor!"</p>

<p>Pecos had no difficulty in thinking. Like
many another man of wandering habits
he had already tasted the bitterness of "ten
dollars or ten days." The hyenas of the law
had gathered him in while he was innocently
walking down the railroad track and a low-browed
justice of the peace without asking any
useless questions had sentenced him to jail for
vagrancy. Ten days of brooding and hard
fare had not sweetened his disposition any and
he had stepped free with the firm determination
to wreak a notable revenge, but as the
sheriff thoughtfully kept his six-shooter Pecos
had been compelled to postpone that exposition
of popular justice. Nevertheless the details
of his wrongs were still fresh in his mind, and
when he learned from the <i>Voice of Reason</i>
that the constable and judge had made him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
all that trouble for an aggregate fee of six
dollars Pecos was ready to oppose all law, in
whatsoever form it might appear, with summary
violence. And as for the capitalistic
classes—well, Pecos determined to collect his
last month's pay from Old Crit if he had to
take it out of his hide.</p>

<p>When next he rode into Verde Crossing the
hang-dog look which had possessed Pecos Dalhart
since he turned rustler was displaced by a
purposeful frown. He rolled truculently in
the saddle as he came down the middle of the
road, and wasted no time with preliminaries.</p>

<p>"Where's that blankety-blank Old Crit?"
he demanded, racking into the store with his
hand on his hip.</p>

<p>"Gone down to Geronimo to git the mail,"
replied Babe, promptly.</p>

<p>"Well, you tell him I want my pay!"
thundered Pecos, pacing up and down.</p>

<p>"He'll be back to-night, better stay and
tell him yourself," suggested Babe, mildly.</p>

<p>"I'll do that," responded Pecos, nodding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
ominously. "And more'n that—I'll collect
it. What's doin'?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothin'," replied Babe. "There was a
deputy assessor up here the other day and he
left this blank for you to fill out. It gives the
number of your cattle."</p>

<p>"Well, you tell that deputy to go to hell,
will you?"</p>

<p>"Nope," said Babe, "he might take me with
him. It happens he's a deputy sheriff, too!"</p>

<p>"Deputy,—<i>huh</i>!" grumbled Pecos, morosely.
"They all look the same to me. Did
Crit fill out his blank?"</p>

<p>"Sure did. Reported a hundred head of
Wine-glasses. Now what d'ye think of
that?"</p>

<p>Pecos paused and meditated on the matter
for an instant. It was doubtful if Crittenden
could gather more than a hundred head of
Wine-glasses, all told. Some of them had
drifted back to their old range and the rest
were scattered in a rough country. "Looks
like that deputy threw a scare into him," he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
observed, dubiously. "What did he say about
my cattle?"</p>

<p>"Well, he said you'd registered a new brand
and now it was up to you to show that you had
some cattle. If you've got 'em you ought to
pay taxes on 'em and if you haven't got any
you got no business with an iron that will burn
over Upton's U."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's the racket, is it? Well, you tell
that deputy that I've got cattle in that brand
and I've got a bill of sale for 'em, all regular,
but I've yet to see the deputy sheriff that can
collect taxes off of me. D'ye think I'm goin'
to chip in to help pay the salary of a man that
makes a business of rollin' drunks and throwin'
honest workingmen into the hoosegatho when
he's in town? Ump-um—guess again!"</p>

<p>He motioned for a drink and Babe regarded
him curiously as he set out the bottle.</p>

<p>"You been readin' the <i>Voice</i>, I reckon," he
said, absent-mindedly pouring out a drink for
himself. "Well, say, did you read that article
on the fee system? It's all true, Pardner,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
every word of it, and more! I'm a man of
good family and education—I was brought
up right and my folks are respectable people—and
yet every time I go to Geronimo they
throw me into jail. Two-twenty-five, that's
what they do it for—and there I have to lay,
half the time with some yegg or lousy gang
of hobos, until they git ready to turn me loose.
And they call that justice! Pecos, I'm going
back to Geronimo—I'm going to stand on
the corner, just the way I used to when I was
drunk, and tell the people it's all <i>wrong</i>!
You're a good man, Pecos—Cumrad—will
you go with me?"</p>

<p>Pecos stood and looked at him, wondering.
"Comrade" sounded good to him; it was the
word they used in the <i>Voice of Reason</i>—"Comrade
Jones has just sent us in four more
subscriptions. That's what throws a crook
into the tail of monopoly. Bully for you,
Comrade!" But with all his fervor he did not
fail to notice the droop to Angy's eyes, the
flush on his cheeks, and the slack tremulousness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
of his lips—in spite of his solemn resolutions
Angy had undoubtedly given way to the
Demon Drink.</p>

<p>"Nope," he said, "I like you, Angy, but
they'd throw us both in. You'd better stay
up here and watch me put it on Crit. 'Don't
rope a bigger bull than you can throw,' is my
motto, and Old Crit is jest my size. I'm
goin' to comb his hair with a six-shooter or
I'll have my money—and then if that dog-robber
of a deputy sheriff shows up I'll—well,
he'd better not crowd me, that's all.
Here's to the revolution—will you drink it,
old Red-eye?"</p>

<p>Angy drank it, and another to keep it
company.</p>

<p>"Pecos," he said, his voice tremulous with
emotion, "when I think how my life has been
ruined by these hirelings of the law, when I
think of the precious days I have wasted in
the confinement of the Geronimo jail, I could
rise up and <i>destroy</i> them, these fiends in human
form and their accursed jails; I could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
wreck every prison in the land and proclaim
liberty from the street-corners—whoop!"
He waved one hand above his head, laughed,
and leapt to a seat upon the bar. "But don't
you imagine f'r a moment, my friend," he continued,
with the impressive gravity of an
orator, "that they have escaped unscathed.
It was not until I had read that wonderful
champion of the common people, the <i>Voice of
Reason</i>, that I realized the enormity of this
conspiracy which has reduced me to my present
condition, but from my first incarceration
in the Geronimo jail I have been a Thorne in
their side, as the Geronimo <i>Blade</i> well said.
I remember as if it were yesterday the time
when they erected their first prison, over
twenty years ago, on account of losing some
hoss-thieves. It was a new structure, strongly
built of adobe bricks, and in a spirit of jest the
town marshal arrested me and locked me up
to see if it was tight. That night when all
was still I wrenched one of the iron bars loose
and dug my way to freedom! But what is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
freedom to revenge? After I had escaped I
packed wood in through the same hole, piled
it up against the door, and set the dam' hell-hole
afire!"</p>

<p>He paused and gazed upon Pecos with
drunken triumph. "That's the kind of an
<i>hombre</i> I am," he said. "But what is one
determined man against a thousand? When
the citizens of Geronimo beheld their new
calaboose ruined and in flames they went over
the country with a fine-tooth comb and never
let up until they had brought me back and
shackled me to the old Cottonwood log down
by the canal—the one they had always used
before they lost the hoss-thieves. That was
the only jail they had left, now that the calaboose
was burned. In vain I pleaded with
them for just one drink—they were inexorable,
the cowardly curs, and there they left
me, chained like a beast, while they went up
town and swilled whiskey until far into the
night. As the first faint light of morning
shot across the desert I awoke with a terrible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
thirst. My suffering was awful. I filled my
mouth with the vile ditch-water and spat it
out again, unsatisfied—I shook my chains
and howled for mercy. But what mercy could
one expect from such a pack of curs? I tested
every link in my chain, and the bolt that passed
through the log—then, with the strength of
desperation I laid hold upon that enormous
tree-trunk and rolled it into the water! Yes,
sir, I rolled the old jail-log into the canal and
jumped straddle of it like a conqueror, and
whatever happened after that I knew I had
the laugh on old Hickey, the Town Marshal,
unless some one saw me sailing by. But luck
was with me, boy; I floated that big log clean
through town and down to Old Manuel's road-house—a
Mexican deadfall out on the edge
of the desert—and swapped it for two drinks
of mescal that would simply make you scream!
By Joe, that liquor tasted good—have one
with me now!"</p>

<p>They drank once more, still pledging the
revolution, and then Angy went ahead on his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
talking jag. "Maybe you've heard of this
Baron Mun-chawson, the German character
that was such a dam' liar and jail-breaker the
king made a prison to order and walled him
in? Well, sir, Mun-chawson worked seven
years with a single nail on that prison and dug
out in spite of hell. But human nature's the
same, wherever you go—always stern and
pitiless. When those Geronimo citizens found
out that old Angy had stole their cottonwood
log and traded it to a wood-chopper for the
drinks, they went ahead and built a double-decked,
steel-celled county jail and sentenced
me to it for life! Conspicuous drunkenness
was the charge—and grand larceny of a jail—but
answer me, my friend, is this a free
country or is the spirit that animated our forefathers
dead? Is the spirit of Patrick Henry
when he cried, 'Give me liberty or give me
death,' buried in the oblivion of the past? Tell
me that, now!"</p>

<p>"Don't know," responded Pecos, lightly,
"too deep a question for me—but say, gimme
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
one more drink and then I'm goin' down the
road to collect my pay from Crit. I'm a man
of action—that's where I shine—I refer all
such matters to Judge Colt." He slapped his
gun affectionately and clanked resolutely out
of the door. Half a mile down the river he
sighted his quarry and rode in on him warily.
Old Crit was alone, driving a discouraged team
of Mexican horses, and as the bouquet of
Pecos's breath drifted in to him over the front
wheel the Boss of Verde Crossing regretted
for once the fiery quality of his whiskey.</p>

<p>"I come down to collect my pay," observed
Pecos, plucking nervously at his gun.</p>

<p>"Well, you don't collect a cent off of me,"
replied Crit, defiantly, "a man that will steal
the way you did! Whenever you git ready
to leave this country I might give you a hundred
or so for your brand, but you better
hurry up. There was a deputy sheriff up
here the other day, lookin' for you!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I heard about it," sneered Pecos.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
"I reckon he was lookin' for evidence about
this here Wine-glass iron."</p>

<p>A smothered curse escaped the lips of Isaac
Crittenden, but, being old at the game, he understood.
There was nothing for it but to
pay up—and wait.</p>

<p>"Well, what guarantee do I git that you
don't give the whole snap away anyhow?" he
demanded, fiercely. "What's the use of me
payin' you anything—I might as well keep
it to hire a lawyer."</p>

<p>"As long as you pay me what you owe me,"
said Pecos, slowly, "and treat me square,"
he added, "I keep my mouth shut. But the
minute you git foxy or try some ranikaboo
play like sayin' the deputy was after me—look
out! Now they was a matter of a hundred
and twenty dollars between us—do I
git it or don't I?"</p>

<p>"You git it," grumbled Crittenden, reluctantly.
"But say, I want you to keep away
from Verde Crossing. Some of them Wine-glass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
cows have drifted back onto the upper
range and John Upton has made a roar.
More than that, Boone Morgan has undertook
to collect our taxes up here and if that deputy
of his ever gits hold of you he's goin' to ask
some mighty p'inted questions. So you better
stay away, see?"</p>

<p>He counted out the money and held it in his
hand, waiting for consent, but Pecos only
laughed.</p>

<p>"Life's too short to be hidin' out from a
deputy," he answered, shortly. "So gimme
that money and I'll be on my way." He
leaned over and plucked the bills from Crit's
hand; then, spurring back toward the Crossing
he left Old Crit, speechless with rage, to
follow in his dust.</p>

<p>A loud war-whoop from the store and the
high-voiced ranting of Babe made it plain to
Crit that there was no use going there—Angy
was launched on one of his periodicals
and Pecos was keeping him company—which
being the case there was nothing for it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
but to let them take the town. The grizzled
Boss of Verde stood by the corral for a minute,
listening to the riot and studying on where to
put in his time; then a slow smile crept over
his hardened visage and he fixed his sinister
eye on the adobe of Joe Garcia. All was fair,
with him, in love or war, and Marcelina was
growing up to be a woman.</p>

<p>"Joe," he said, turning upon his corral boss,
"you tell your wife I'll be over there in a
minute for supper—and say, I want you to
stay in the store to-night; them crazy fools will
set the house afire."</p>

<p>"<i>Stawano</i>," mumbled José, but as he turned
away there was an angry glint in his downcast
eye and he cursed with every breath. It is not
always pleasant, even to a Mexican, to be
in debt to the Boss.</p>

   <h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>

<p class="ac">THE REVOLUTION</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE coyotes who from their seven hills
along the Verde were accustomed to
make Rome howl found themselves outclassed
and left to a thinking part on the night that
Pecos Dalhart and Angevine Thorne celebrated
the dawn of Reason. The French
Revolution being on a larger scale, and, above
all, successful, has come down in history as a
great social movement; all that can be said of
the revolution at Verde Crossing is packed
away in those sad words: it failed. It started,
like most revolutions, with a careless word, hot
from the vitriolic pen of some space-writer gone
mad, and ended in that amiable disorder which,
for lack of a better word, we call anarchy.
Whiskey was at the bottom of it, of course,
and it meant no more than a tale told by an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
idiot, "full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."
At the same time, it managed by degrees
to engross the entire attention of Verde
Crossing and after the fall of the Bastile,
as symbolized by the cracking of a bottle, it
left Pecos and Babe more convinced than ever
that the world was arrayed against them.</p>

<p>In the early part of the evening, according
to orders, José Garcia watched them furtively
through the open door, returning at intervals,
however, to peer through the window of his
own home. At each visit it seemed to him that
Angy was getting drunker and the Boss more
shameless in his attentions to Marcelina. At
last, when he could stand the strain no longer,
he threw in with the merry roisterers, leaving
it to the Señora to protect the dignity of their
home. A drink or two mellowed him to their
propaganda—at the mention of Crit he burst
into a torrent of curses and as the night wore
on he declared for the revolution, looking for
his immediate revenge in drinking up all the
Boss's whiskey. In the end their revelry rose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
to such a height that Crittenden was drawn
away from his rough wooing and finally, under
the pretence of delivering the United
States mail, he walked boldly in upon them,
determined to protect his property at any risk.
The penalty for interfering with the United
States mail, as everybody who has ever read
the card on a drop-box knows, is a fine of
$1,000, or imprisonment, or both. In defence
of that precious packet Crittenden could have
killed all three of them and stood justified before
the law, but although he had a reputation
as a bad man to crowd into a corner, Old Crit
was not of a sanguinary disposition. No man
could hold down a bunch of gun-men of the
kind that he employed in his predatory round-ups
and not have a little iron in his blood, but
the Boss of Verde Crossing had seen all too
well in his variegated career the evils which
cluster like flies about an act of violence, and he
was always for peace—peace and his price.</p>

<p>"Here; here, here," he expostulated, as he
found Angy in the act of drinking half a pint
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
of whiskey by measure, "you boys are hittin' it
pretty high, ain't ye?"</p>

<p>"The roof's the limit," replied Babe, facetiously.
"As the Champeen Booze-fighter of
Arizona I am engaged in demonstratin' to all
beholders my claim to that illustrious title.
Half a pint of whiskey—enough to kill an
Injun or pickle a Gila-monster—and all
tossed off at a single bout, like the nectar of
the gods. Here's to the revolution, and to
hell with the oppressors of the poor!"</p>

<p>"That's right," chimed in Pecos, elevating
his glass and peering savagely over its rim at
the Boss, "we done declared a feud against the
capitulistic classes and the monneypullistic
tendencies of the times. Your game's played
out, Old Man; the common people have riz in
their might and took the town! Now you go
away back in the corner, d'ye understand, and
sit down—and don't let me hear a word out
of you or I'll beat the fear o' God into you
with <i>this</i>!" He hauled out his heavy six-shooter
and made the sinister motions of striking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
a man over the head with it, but Crit chose
to ignore the threat.</p>

<p>"All right," he said, feigning an indulgent
smile, "you boys seem to be enjoyin' yourselves,
so I'll jest deliver this United States
mail as the law requires and leave you to yourselves."
He stepped in behind the bar,
chucked a couple of demijohns of whiskey into
the corner where they might be overlooked, and
threw the mail pouch on the counter.</p>

<p>"Better come up and git your mail, boys,"
he observed, dumping the contents out for a
lure. "Hey, here's a package for you, Mr.
Dalhart—something pretty choice, I 'spect.
Nothin' for you, Joe," he scowled, as his faithless
retainer lurched up to claim his share.
"Here's your paper, Babe. Letter for you,
Mr. Dalhart," he continued, flipping a large,
official envelope across the bar, "you're developin'
quite a correspondence!" He ducked
down behind the counter, grinning at his stratagem,
and while Pecos and Babe were examining
their mail he managed to jerk the money
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
drawer open and slip the loose change into his
pockets.</p>

<p>"Well, we'll be goin' home now, Joe," he
said, taking the corral boss briskly by the arm.
"Come on, <i>hombre</i>, you ain't got no mail!"
Under ordinary circumstances José would have
followed peaceably, thus reducing the revolutionary
forces to a minimum, but the covert insult
to his daughter, magnified by drink, had
fired his Latin blood.</p>

<p>"No, Señor," he replied, fixing his glittering
eyes upon the hateful boss. "<i>Yo no go! Carramba,
que malo hombre!</i> You dam' coward,
Creet—you scare my wife—you scare—"</p>

<p>"Shut up!" hissed Crit, hastily cuffing him
over the head. "Shut your mouth or I'll—"</p>

<p>"<i>Diablo!</i>" shrieked the Mexican, striking
back blindly. "I keel you! You have to leave
<i>mi niña</i> alone!"</p>

<p>"What's that?" yelled Angevine Thorne,
leaping with drunken impetuosity into the fray,
"hev you been—"</p>

<p>"Leave him to me!" shouted Pecos, wading
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
recklessly into the scrimmage. "I'll fix the
blankety-blank, whatever he's gone and done!
Throw him loose, boys; I'll take the
<i>one-eyed</i>—<i>hump-backed</i>—<i>dog-robbin'</i>—<i>dastard</i>"—he
accompanied each epithet with a blow—"and
tie 'im into a bow knot!" He grabbed
Old Crit out of the <i>mêlée</i> and held him against
the wall with a hand of iron. "What do you
mean by slappin' my friend and cumrad?" he
thundered, making as if to annihilate him with
a blow. "I want you to understand, Old
Cock Eye, that Mr. Garcia is my friend—he
comes from a fine old Spanish family, away
down in Sonory, and his rights must be respected!
Ain't that so, Angy?"</p>

<p>"From the pure, Castilian blood," declaimed
Angy, waving his hand largely, "a gentleman
to whom I take off my hat—his estimable wife
and family—"</p>

<p>"Now here, boys," broke in Crittenden, taking
his cue instantly, "this joke has gone far
enough. Mr. Garcia's wife asked me to bring
him home—you see what his condition is—and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
I was tryin' to do my best. Now jest take
your hand off of me, Mr. Dalhart—yes,
thanks—and Angy, you see if you can't git
'im to go home. A man of family, you know,"
he went on, craftily enlisting their sympathies,
"ought to—"</p>

<p>"Sure thing!" responded Angevine Thorne,
lovingly twining his arm around his Spanish-American
comrade. "Grab a root there,
Pecos, and we'll take 'im home in style!"</p>

<p>"Wait till I git my package!" cried Pecos,
suddenly breaking his hold, and he turned
around just in time to see Crit skipping out the
back door.</p>

<p>"Well, run then, you dastard!" he apostrophized,
waving one hand as he tenderly gathered
up his mail-order dry goods. "I can't stop
to take after ye now. This here package is
f'r my little Señorita, Marcelina, and I'm
goin' to present it like a gentleman and ast her
for a kiss. Hey, Angy," he called, as he re-engaged
himself with José, "how do you say
'kiss' in Spanish? Aw, shut up, I don't believe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
ye! Stan' up here, Joe—well, it don't sound
good, that's all—I'm goin' to ast her in
U. S., and take a chance!"</p>

<p>The procession lurched drunkenly up the
road and like most such was not received with
the cordiality which had been anticipated.
The Señora Garcia was already furious at Old
Crit and when Pecos Dalhart, after delivering
her recreant husband, undertook to present the
dainty aprons and the blue handkerchiefs,
marked M, which he had ordered specially for
her daughter, she burst into a torrent of Spanish
and hurled them at his head. "<i>Muy malo</i>,"
"<i>borracho</i>," and "<i>vaya se</i>," were a few of the
evil words which followed them and by the
gestures alone Pecos knew that he had been
called a bad man and a drunkard and told in
two words to go. He went, and with him
Angy, ever ready to initiate new orgies and
help drown his sorrows in the flowing cup.
The noise of their bacchanalia rose higher and
higher; pistol-shots rang out as Pecos shot off
the necks of bottles which personified for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
moment his hated rival; and to Crit, lingering
outside the back door, it seemed as if their
howling and ranting would never cease. It
was no new experience for him to break in on
one of Angy's jags, but things were coming too
high and fast with Pecos Dalhart present, and
he decided to wait for his revenge until they
were both thoroughly paralyzed.</p>

<p>"But what is this 'cumrad' talk and them
yells for the revolution?" he soliloquized, as
Angy and Pecos returned to their religion.
"Is it a G. A. R. reunion or has Joe worked
in a Mexican revolution on us? Yes, holler,
you crazy fools; it'll be Old Crit's turn, when
you come to pay the bills."</p>

<p>The first gray light of dawn was striking
through the door when Crittenden tip-toed
cautiously into the store and gazed about at the
wreckage and the sprawling hulks of the revellers.
Pecos lay on his face with his huge silver
mounted spurs tangled in the potato sack
that had thrown him; and Babe, his round
moon-face and bald crown still red from his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
unrestrained potations, was draped along the
bar like a shop kitten. Old Crit shook him
roughly and, receiving no response, turned his
attention to Pecos Dalhart. His first care was
to snap the cartridges out of his six-shooter and
jamb the action with a generous handful of
dirt; then he felt his pockets over carefully,
looking for his roll, for Pecos had undoubtedly
consumed a great deal of liquor and ought not
to be deprived of the cowboy's privilege of
waking up broke. But as luck would have it
he was lying upon his treasure and could not
pay his reckoning. The only article of interest
which the search produced was a grimy section
of a newspaper, stored away in his vest pocket,
and Crit seized upon it eagerly. It was a not
uncommon failing of Texas bad men, as he
knew them, to carry newspaper accounts of
their past misdeeds upon their persons and he
unfolded the sheet with the full expectation of
finding a sheriff's offer of reward.</p>

<p>"<i>It's a crime to be Poor!!!</i>" was the heading,
"And the penalty is hard labor for life!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
it added, briefly. There is something in that,
too; but philosophy did not appeal to Crittenden
at the moment—he was looking for Pecos
Dalhart's name and the record of his crime.
"The grinding tyranny of the capitalistic
classes—" he read, and then his eye ran down
the page until he encountered the words:
"Yours for the Revolution!" and "Subscribe
for the <i>Voice of Reason</i>!" Then a great light
came over him and he gnashed his teeth in a
fury.</p>

<p>"Well, the dam', yaller, two-bit-a-year
sheet!" he raved, snatching a fresh copy of the
<i>Voice of Reason</i> from the sacred United States
mail and hastily scanning its headlines, "and if
these crazy fools hain't gone and took it serious!"
He tore it in two and jumped on it.
"Two-bits a year!" he raged, "and for four-bits
I could've got the <i>Fireside Companion</i>!"
He rummaged around in the box and gathered
up every copy, determined to hurl them into
the fireplace, but on the way the yellow wrapper
with the United States stamp arrested his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
eye, and he paused. After all, they were
United States mail—penalty for destroying
$1,000—and would have to go back into the
box.</p>

<p>"Well," he grumbled, dumping them sullenly
back, "mebby it was that new bar'l of
whiskey—I s'pose they've got to holler about
something when they're drunk, the dam'
eejits!" He strode up and down the floor,
scowling at the unconscious forms of the roisterers
who had beaten him the night before—then
he turned back and laid violent hands
upon Angy.</p>

<p>"Git off'n there, you low-down, lazy hound!"
he yelled, dragging him roughly to the floor.
"You <i>will</i> start a revolution and try to kill your
boss, will you? <i>You're fired!</i>" he shouted
when, after a liberal drenching, he had brought
Babe back to the world.</p>

<p>"Well, gimme my pay, then," returned
Angy, holding out his hand and blinking.</p>

<p>"You don't git no pay!" declared Crit, with
decision. "Who's goin' to pay for all that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
liquor that was drunk last night? Look at
them empty bottles, will you? You go and
bring in all your friends and open up the town
and the next mornin' I look in the till and they
ain't a dam' cent!"</p>

<p>"Well, I want my pay," reiterated Babe,
drunkenly. "I been workin' a long time, now—I'm
goin' to draw my money an' go home!
'<i>My mother's heart is breakin', breakin' f'r
me, an' that's all</i>—'" he crooned, and, rocking
to and fro on the floor, he sang himself back to
sleep.</p>

<p>Old Crit watched him a moment, sneering;
then with vindictive exultation he turned his
attention to Pecos. "Git up," he snarled, kicking
the upturned soles of his feet, "this ain't no
bunk-house! Git out'r here, now; you been
pesterin' around these parts too long!" He
seized the prostrate cowboy by his broad shoulders
and snaked him summarily out the door,
where he lay sprawling in the dirt, like a turtle
on its back, a mock of his strong, young manhood.
To the case-hardened Babe the venom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
of Old Crit's whiskey was no worse than a
death-potion of morphine to an opium fiend,
but Pecos was completely paralyzed by the
poison. He responded neither to kicks and
man-handling nor to frequent dashes of water
and at last Crittenden dragged him out behind
the corral and left him there, a sight for gods
and men. The Garcia dogs crept up furtively
and sniffed at him and the Señora pointed him
out to her children as an awful example of
<i>Texano</i> depravity, and also as the bad man
who had corrupted their <i>papa</i>. Even Marcelina
wavered in her secret devotion, but after
he had finally clambered up on his horse and
ridden blindly off toward Lost Dog Cañon
the thought of those blue silk handkerchiefs,
branded M, rose up in her mind and comforted
her.</p>

</div>

<p class="ac">THE DAY AFTER</p>

<p class="drop-cap">IN a land where the desert is king the prolonged
absence of even so undesirable a
citizen as Pecos Dalhart is sure, after a while,
to occasion comment. For Pecos had ridden
out on the Carrizo trail without water, and the
barren mesa had already claimed its dead from
thirst. He was also hardly in his right mind,
and though his horse knew the way home he
might easily have arrived there without his
master. José Garcia was the first to mention
the matter to Old Crit, and received a hearty
cursing for his pains. Another week passed
by, making three, and still the cowboy did not
come in for his mail. The bunch of dissipated
punchers who lingered around the bunk-house
under pretence of riding the range finally
worked up quite a hectic interest in the affair,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
but none of them volunteered to make a search.
The chances were that Mr. Dalhart, if still
alive, was in an ugly mood—perhaps locoed by
Crit's well-known brand of whiskey—and it
would be dangerous for an IC man to ride in
on him. As for Crit, his asperity wore down a
little as the days of absence lengthened away;
he retracted several statements which he had
made to the effect that he hoped the blankety-blank
was dead, and when one of Boone Morgan's
deputies finally rode in to investigate the
rumor he told him he was afraid the poor fellow
had wandered out across the desert and perished
of hunger and thirst.</p>

<p>Bill Todhunter was Boone Morgan's regular
mountain deputy—sent out to look into
all such affairs as this, and incidentally to get
evidence which would come handy in the big
tax-collecting that was being planned for the
fall. He asked a few questions, whistled
through his teeth and pondered the matter for
a while, meanwhile scrutinizing the hard countenance
of his informant with the speculative
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
cynicism of his profession. This was not the
first sad case that he had looked into where a
man who was not really needed in the community
had mysteriously disappeared, and in one
desert tragedy which he had in mind the corpse
had assayed more than a trace of lead.</p>

<p>"Did this man Dalhart ever fill out that assessor's
blank I left for 'im?" he inquired, after
a long pause, meanwhile squatting down and
drawing cattle brands in the dirt.</p>

<p>"Don't know," replied Crit, shortly.</p>

<p>"Let's see, his brand was a Wine-glass,
wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Nope—Monkey-wrench."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! Sure! I knew they was two new
irons in there, but I got 'em mixed. The
Wine-glass is yourn, ain't it?"</p>

<p>Crittenden nodded sullenly. It was the
particular phase of his relations with Pecos
Dalhart which he would rather not discuss with
an officer. As for the deputy, he spun the
wheel in his spur, whistled "Paloma," and
looked out toward the east.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>"Has he got any mail here waitin' for 'im?"
he asked, rising slowly from his heels. "Well,
you better give it to me, then—and a little
grub. I've always wanted to take a look at
that Lost Dog country, anyway."</p>

<p>It was a long trail and the tracks were a
month old, but Pecos's had been the last shod
horse to travel it and what few cattle there
were in the country had not been able to obscure
the shoe-marks. Following those ancient
signs Bill Todhunter worked his way
gradually into what had been up to that time,
No Man's Land, not forgetting to count the
Wine-glass cattle as he passed the water holes.
Not so many years before the Apaches had
held full sway over all the Tonto and Verde
country and when the first settlers came in they
had naturally located along the rivers, leaving
the barren mountains to the last. It was a
long way from nowhere, that mysterious little
Lost Dog Cañon, and when the deputy rode
into it looking for a man whose trail was a
month old he felt the sobering influence of its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
funereal cliffs. Black and forbidding, they
bent bodingly over the tiny valley with its
grove of cottonwoods and wild walnuts, and
upon the western rim a squalid group of buzzards
dozed as if they had made a feast. At
the edge of the stream Todhunter reined in his
horse, but though his flanks were gaunted the
animal would not drink. Instead he raised his
head and snuffed the air, curiously. It looked
ominous, for they were at the end of the trail
and the tracks still pointed in. The deputy
spurred nervously across the stream, still with
his eye out for signs, and fetched up with a
jerk. There, fresh and clean in the moist sand,
were the imprints of a man's boots, coming
down to the water—and not once or twice, but
a dozen times.</p>

<p>"Ahem," coughed Todhunter, turning into
the path, "stan' up hyar, bronc—what's the
matter with you!" He jerked his unoffending
horse out of the trail and clattered him over
the rocks, for your true officer does not crowd
in with drawn pistol on a man he cannot see.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
The deputy was strictly a man of peace—and
he tried to look the part. His badge was
pinned carefully to the inside flap of his vest
and if he had a gun anywhere it did not show.
He swung his quirt in one hand, idly slapping
it against his chaps, and then, having offered
every sign that he came openly and as a friend,
he rode cautiously up to the camp.</p>

<p>There was a fire smouldering upon a stone-walled
mound at the entrance to the cave and
beside it, reclining in a rustic chair, sat Pecos
Dalhart—watchful, silent, alert. In one
hand he held a cigarette and the other supported
a grimy newspaper which he had been
reading. Behind him on tall poles were boxes
filled with food, protected by tin cans, mushroomed
out around the posts to keep the rats
from climbing. His saddle was hung up carefully
on a rack and his carbine leaned against
the chair where he was sitting, but though he
had seen no one for a month Pecos barely
glanced up from his paper as the stranger drew
near.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>"How'd do," observed the deputy, sitting at
ease in his saddle.</p>

<p>"Howdy," Pecos grunted, and languidly
touching his dead cigarette to a coal he proceeded
with his reading. Todhunter looked
his camp over critically, took note of the
amount of food stored in the rat-proof boxes
and of the ingenious workmanship on the
rustic chair; then his eyes wandered back and
fixed themselves on Pecos. Instead of the
roistering boy he had expected he beheld a full-grown
man with a month's growth of curly
beard and his jaw set like a steel-trap, as if,
after all, he was not unprepared for trouble.
His hat, however, was shoved back carelessly
on his bushy head, his legs crossed, and his pose
was that of elegant and luxurious ease. To
the left arm of his chair he had attached a
horse's hoof, bottom up, in the frog of which
he laid his cigarettes; to the right was fastened
a little box filled with tobacco and brown papers,
and the fire, smouldering upon its altar,
was just close enough to provide a light. Evidently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
the lone inhabitant of the cañon had
made every endeavor to be comfortable and
was not above doing a little play-acting to convey
the idea of unconcern, but the deputy sheriff
did not fail to notice the carbine, close at
hand, and the pistol by his side. It seemed to
him also that while his man was apparently
deeply immersed in his month-old paper, his
eyes, staring and intent, looked past it and
watched his every move. The conversation
having ceased, then, and his curiosity having
been satisfied, Bill Todhunter leaned slowly
back to his saddle bags and began to untie a
package.</p>

<p>"Are you Mr. Dalhart?" he inquired, as the
cowboy met his eye.</p>

<p>"That's my name," replied Pecos, stiffly.</p>

<p>"Well, I've got s'm' papers for you," observed
the deputy, enigmatically, and if he had
been in two minds as to the way Pecos would
take this statement his doubts were instantly
set at rest. At the word "papers"—the same
being used for "warrants" by most officers of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
the law—the cowboy rose up in his chair and
laid one hand on the butt of his revolver.</p>

<p>"Not for me!" he said, a cold, steely-blue
look comin' into his eyes. "It'll take a better
man than you to serve 'em!"</p>

<p>"These are newspapers," corrected the deputy,
quietly. "Yore friends down on the
Verde, not havin' seen you for some time, asked
me to take out yore mail and see if you was
all right."</p>

<p>"Oh!" grunted Pecos, suspiciously.</p>

<p>"And, bein' as you seem to be all O. K.,"
continued Todhunter, pacifically, "I'll jest
turn 'em over to you and be on my way." He
threw the bundle at his feet, wheeled his horse
and without another word rode soberly down
the trail.</p>

<p>"Hey!" shouted Pecos, as the stranger
plunged through the creek, but if Todhunter
heard him he made no sign. There are some
people who never know when to go, but Bill
Todhunter was not that kind.</p>

<p>"No, you bet that feller ain't dead," he observed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
when Crittenden and the chance residents
of Verde Crossing gathered about him
to hear the news. "He's sure up an' comin',
and on the prod bigger 'n a wolf. I wouldn't
like to say whether he's quite right in the head
or not but I reckon it'll pay to humor 'im a
little. He'll be down here for grub in about
another week, too."</p>

<p>The week passed, but not without its happenings
to Verde Crossing. The first event was
the return of Angevine Thorne from Geronimo,
after a prolonged stay in the city Bastile.
Crit sent the bail money down by Todhunter
immediately upon hearing the news that Pecos
Dalhart was alive and on the prod. The only
man on the Verde who had any influence with
Pecos was his old "cumrad," Babe, and Crittenden
was anxious to get that genial soul back
before Pecos came in for supplies. But the
same buckboard that brought the Champion of
Arizona back to his old haunts took his little
friend Marcelina away, and the only reason
the Señora would give was that her daughter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
was going to school. In vain Babe palavered
her in Spanish and cross-questioned the stolid
José. The fear of her lawless wooer was upon
them—for were they not in debt to Crit—and
not even by indirection would the fiery
Señora give vent to the rage which burned in
her heart.</p>

<p>"This is not a good place for my daughter,"
she said, her eyes carefully fixed upon the
ground. "It is better that she should go to the
Sisters' school and learn her catechism." So
Marcelina was sent away from the evil men of
Verde, for she was already a woman; but in
the haste of packing she managed to snatch
just one of the forbidden blue handkerchiefs,
branded M.</p>

<p>It was a sombre welcome which awaited the
lone rustler of Lost Dog Cañon when, driven
perforce to town, he led his pack-horse up to
the store. For a minute he sat in his saddle,
silent and watchful; then, throwing his bridle-reins
on the ground, he stalked defiantly
through the door. A couple of IC cowboys
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
were sitting at the card-table in the corner,
playing a three-handed game of poker with
Angy, and at sight of him they measured the
distance to the door with their eyes.</p>

<p>"W'y, hello there, Pecos!" cried Angy, kicking
over the table in his haste to grasp him by
the hand. "Where you been all the time—we
thought for a time here you was dead!"</p>

<p>"Might as well 'a been," said Pecos, gruffly,
"for all anybody <i>give</i> a dam'!"</p>

<p>"Why? What was the matter? Did you
git lost?"</p>

<p>"I lay out on the mesa for two days," answered
the cowboy, briefly, "and about a month
afterwards a feller come out to my camp to
see if I was dead. This is a hell of an outfit,"
he observed, glancing malevolently at the IC
cowboys, "and by the way," he added, "where
was <i>you</i> all the time, Angy?"</p>

<p>Angevine Thorne's lips trembled at this
veiled accusation and he stretched out his
hands pleadingly. "I swear, Pardner," he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
protested, "I never heard a word about it until
last Saturday! I was in the Geronimo jail."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Pecos, and without more words
he gave him his own right hand. The cowboys,
who had been uneasy witnesses of the
scene, seized upon this as a favorable opportunity
to make their escape, leaving the two
of them to talk it out together.</p>

<p>"What in the world happened to us, Angy?"
demanded Pecos in a hushed voice, when the
effusion of reconciliation had passed, "did Crit
put gun-powder in our whiskey or was it a
case of stuffed club? I was plumb paralyzed,
locoed, and cross-eyed for a week—and my
head ain't been right since!" He brushed his
hand past his face and made a motion as of
catching little devils out of the air, but Angy
stayed his arm.</p>

<p>"Nothin' like that, Pecos," he pleaded,
hoarsely, "I'm on the ragged edge of the jim-jams
myself, and if I get to thinkin' of crawly
things I'll sure get 'em! No, it was jest that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
accursed liquor! I don't know what happened—I
remember Crit takin' me down to
Geronimo and givin' me five dollars and then it
was all a dream until I found myself in the jag-cell.
But it's the liquor that does it, Pecos—that
and the capitalistic classes and the officers
of the law. They's no hope for the common
people as long as they keep on drinkin'—there's
always some feller like Crit to skin
'em, and the constables to run 'em in. It's
a conspiracy, I tell you; they're banded together
to drug and rob us—but, Pardner,
there is one man who is going to balk the
cowardly curs. Never, never, never, will I let
another drop of liquor pass my lips!" He
raised his hand to heaven as he swore the familiar
oath, hoping and yet not hoping that
some power would come down to him to help
him fight his fate. "Will you join me,
Cumrad?" he asked, laying hold of Pecos's
shoulder. "You will? Well, let's shake on it—here's
to the revolution!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>They shook, and turned instinctively toward
the bar, but such a pledge cannot be cemented
in the usual manner, so Angy led the way outside
and sought a seat in the shade.</p>

<p>"Where's my little friend Marcelina?" inquired
Pecos, after a long look at the white
adobe with the brush <i>ramada</i> which housed the
Garcia family, "hidin' behind a straw somewhere?"</p>

<p>"Gone!" said Angy, solemnly. "Gone, I
know not where."</p>

<p>"What—you don't mean to say—" cried
Pecos, starting up.</p>

<p>"Her mother sent her down to Geronimo
the day that I came up," continued Babe, winking
fast. "It looks as if she fears my influence,
but she will not say. Poor little Marcelina—how
I miss her!" He wiped his
eyes with the back of his hand and shook his
head sadly. "Verde ain't been the same to me
since then," he said, "an' life ain't worth livin'.
W'y, Pecos, if I thought we done something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
we oughten to when we was drunk that time
I'd go out and cut my throat—but the Señora
is powerful mad. Kin you recollect what went
on?"</p>

<p>A vision of himself trying to barter his mail-order
package for a kiss flashed up before
Pecos in lines of fire, but he shut his lips and
sat silent. The exaltation and shame of that
moment came back to him in a mighty pang of
sorrow and he bowed his head on his arms.
What if, in the fury of drink and passion, he
had offered some insult to his Señorita—the
girl who had crept unbeknown into his rough
life and filled it with her smile! No further
memory of that black night was seared into
his clouded brain—the vision ended with the
presentation of the package. What followed
was confined only to the limitations of man's
brutal whims. For a minute Pecos contemplated
this wreck of all his hopes—then, from
the abyss of his despair there rose a voice that
cried for revenge. Revenge for his muddled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
brain, for the passion which came with drink:
revenge for his girl, whom he had lost by some
foolish drunken freak! He leapt to his feet
in a fury.</p>

<p>"It's that dastard, Crit!" he cried, shaking
his fists in the air. "He sold us his cussed
whiskey—he sent us on our way! And now
I'm goin' to git him!"</p>

<p>Angy gazed up at him questioningly and
then raised a restraining hand.</p>

<p>"It's more than him, Cumrad," he said
solemnly. "More than him! If Crit should
die to-morrow the system would raise up another
robber to take his place. It's the System,
Pecos, the System—this here awful
conspiracy of the capitalistic classes and the
servile officers of the law—that keeps the poor
man down. Worse, aye, worse than the
Demon Rum, is the machinations which puts
the power of government into the monopolistic
hands of capital and bids the workingman earn
his bread by the sweat of his brow. There is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
only one answer to the crime of government—the
revolution!"</p>

<p>"Well, let 'er go then," cried Pecos, impulsively.
"The revolution she is until the
last card falls—but all the same I got my eye
on Crit!"</p>

</div>

<p class="ac">DEATH AND TAXES</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE iron hand of the law after hovering
long above the Verde at last descended
suddenly and with crushing force upon the
unsuspecting cowmen. For a year Boone
Morgan had been dallying around, even as
other sheriffs had done before him, and the
first fears of the wary mountain men had
speedily been lulled into a feeling of false security.
Then the fall round-ups came on and
in the general scramble of that predatory
period Morgan managed to scatter a posse of
newly appointed deputies, disguised as cowboys,
throughout the upper range. They returned
and reported the tally at every branding
and the next week every cowman on the
Verde received notice that his taxes on so
many head of cattle, corral count, were due
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
and more than due. They were due for several
years back but Mr. Boone Morgan, as
deputy assessor, deputy tax-collector, and so
forth, would give them a receipt in full upon
the payment of the fiscal demand. This would
have sounded technical in the mouth of an
ordinary tax-collector but coming from a large,
iron-gray gentleman with a six-shooter that
had been through the war, it went. Upton
paid; Crittenden paid; they all paid—all except
Pecos Dalhart.</p>

<p>It was at the store, shortly after he had put
the thumb-screws on Ike Crittenden and extracted
the last ultimate cent, that Boone
Morgan tackled Pecos for his taxes. He had
received a vivid word-picture of the lone resident
of Lost Dog from his deputy, Bill Todhunter,
and Pecos had been equally fortified
against surprise by Angevine Thorne. They
came face to face as Pecos was running over
the scare-heads of the <i>Voice of Reason</i>, and
the hardy citizens of Verde Crossing held their
breaths and listened for thunder, for Pecos had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
stated publicly that he did not mean to
pay.</p>

<p>"Ah, Mr. Dalhart, I believe," began the
sheriff in that suave and genial manner which
most elected officials have at their command.
"Glad to meet you, Mr. Dalhart. There's a
little matter of business I'd like to discuss, if
you'll jest step outside a moment. Yes,
thank you. Nice weather we're having now—how's
the feed up on your range? That's
good—that's fine. Now, Mr. Dalhart, I
don't suppose you get your mail very regular,
and mebby you ain't much of a correspondent
anyway, but my name's Morgan—I'm a
deputy tax-collector right now—and I'd like
to have you fill out this blank, giving the number
of assessable cattle you have. Sent you
one or two by mail, but this is jest as good.
Sorry, you understand, but the county needs
the money."</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm sorry, too," observed Pecos,
sardonically, "because it'll never git none
from me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I dunno," replied the sheriff, sizing
his man up carefully, "Geronimo County has
been able to take care of itself, so far; and
when I put the matter in its proper light to
men who have been a little lax in the past—men
like Upton and Mr. Crittenden, for instance—they
seem perfectly willing to pay.
These taxes are to support the county government,
you understand—to build roads and
keep up the schools and all that sort of thing—and
every property-owner ought to be glad
to do his share. Now about how many head
of cows have you got up at Lost Dog Cañon?"</p>

<p>"I've got jest about enough to keep me in
meat," answered Pecos, evasively.</p>

<p>"Um, that'd be about two hundred head,
wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>Two hundred was a close guess, and this unexpected
familiarity with his affairs startled
the cowboy, but his face, nevertheless, did not
lose its defiant stare. Two hundred was really
the difference between what U cows Upton
had lost last spring and the total of Crittenden's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
Wine-glass bunch, and Boone Morgan
was deeply interested in the whereabouts of
that particular two hundred head. To Old
Crit, this tax-collecting was only a mean raid
on his pocket-book—to Morgan it was the
first step in his campaign against cattle rustling.
When he had determined the number
of head in every brand he might be able to
prove a theft—but not till then.</p>

<p>"Call it two hundred," he suggested, holding
out the paper encouragingly, but Pecos
drew back his hand scornfully.</p>

<p>"Not if it was a cow and calf," he said, "I
wouldn't pay a cent. D'ye think I want to
pay a government of robbers? What does
yore dam' government do for me, or any other
pore man, but make us trouble?"</p>

<p>"Well, sometimes that's all a government
can do for a certain class of people," observed
the sheriff, eying him coldly, "and I'd like to
say right now, Mr. Dalhart, that in such a
case it can make a hell of a lot of trouble."</p>

<p>Pecos grunted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, jest for instance," continued Morgan,
warming up a little, "in case you don't pay
your taxes on them two hundred head of cattle
I can get judgment against you, seize any or
all of 'em, and sell the whole shooting-match
for taxes. I'll do it, too," he added.</p>

<p>"Well, turn yoreself loose, then," flared
back Pecos, "the bars are down. But I'll tell
you right now, the first deputy tax-collector
that puts a rope on one of my cows, I'll
bounce a rock off'n him—or something
worse!"</p>

<p>"I ain't accustomed to take no threats, Mr.
Dalhart," bellowed Boone Morgan, his temper
getting away with him, "and especially from
a man in your line of business! Now you go
your way, and go as far as you please, but if
I don't put the fear of God into your black,
cattle-rustling heart my name is 'Sic 'em' and
I'm a dog. I'll collect them taxes, sir, <i>next
week</i>!"</p>

<p>"Like hell you will," snarled Pecos, throwing
out his chin. He scowled back at the irate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
officer, cast a baleful glance at the IC punchers,
and mounted from the far side of his horse,
but when he rode away Ike Crittenden went
out behind the corral and laughed until he
choked. After all the trouble this man Dalhart
had made him, just to think of him locking
horns with Boone Morgan! And all from
his crazy reading of the <i>Voice of Reason</i>!
The memory of his own enforced tax-paying
fell away from him like a dream at the thought
of Pecos Dalhart putting up a fight against
the sheriff of Geronimo County, and on the
strength of it he took a couple of drinks and
was good-natured for a week.</p>

<p>If Pecos had had some self-appointed critic
to point out just how foolish he was he might
have seen a new light, gathered up about
twenty head of Monkey-wrench steers and
sold them to pay his taxes; but his only recourse
in this extremity was to the <i>Voice of
Reason</i>, and whatever its other good qualities
are, that journal has never been accused of
preaching moderation and reason. It was war
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
to the knife with Pecos, from the jump, and
the day after his return he took his carbine,
his cigarette makings, and the last <i>Voice of
Reason</i> and went up the trail to lie in wait
for Boone Morgan. The country around
Lost Dog Cañon is mostly set on edge and
the entrance to the valley is through a narrow
and crooked ravine, filled with bowlders and
faced with sun-blackened sandstone rocks,
many of which, from some fracture of their
weathered surface, are pock-marked with
giant "wind-holes." Into one of these natural
pockets, from the shelter of which a single
man could stand off a regiment, Pecos hoisted
himself with the dawn, and he did not leave it
again till dark. As the wind came up and,
sucking in through the opening, hollowed out
each day its little more, the loose sand from
the soft walls blew into Pecos's eyes and he
gave up his fervid reading; but except for that
and for the times when from the blackness of
his cavern he searched the narrow trail for his
enemies, he pored over the <i>Voice of Reason</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
as a Christian martyr might brood over his
Bible. It was his religion, linked with that
far more ancient religion of revenge, and if
Boone Morgan or any other deputy tax collector
had broken in upon his reveries they
certainly would have stopped something worse
than a bouncing stone.</p>

<p>But no one played into his hand to that
extent. They say the Apaches educated the
whole United States army in the art of modern
warfare and Boone Morgan as a frontier Indian
fighter had been there to learn his part.
In the days when Cochise and Geronimo were
loose he had travelled behind Indian scouts
over all kinds of country, and one of the first
things he had mastered was the value of high
ground. He had learned also that one man
in the rocks is worth a troop on the trail and
while he was gathering up a posse to discipline
Pecos Dalhart he sent Bill Todhunter ahead
to prospect. For two long days that wary
deputy haunted the rim-rock that shut in Lost
Dog Cañon, crawling on his belly like a snake,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
and at last, just at sundown, his patience was
rewarded by the sight of the lost Pecos, carbine
in hand, rising up from nowhere and returning
to his camp. As the smoke rose from his
newly lighted fire Todhunter slipped quietly
down the ravine and, stepping from rock to
rock, followed the well-trampled trail till he
came to the mouth of the wind-cave. Peering
cautiously in he caught the odor of stale
tobacco smoke and saw the litter of old papers
on the sandy floor, signs enough that Pecos
lived there—then, as the strategy and purpose
of the cattle-rustler became plain, he
picked his way back to his lonely camp and
waited for another day. With the dawn he
was up again and watching, and when he saw
Pecos come back and hide himself in his wind-cave
he straightened up and set about his
second quest—the search for the Monkey-wrench
cattle. At the time of his first visit
to Lost Dog he had seen a few along the creek
but there must be more of them down the
cañon, and the farther away they could be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
found the better it would suit his chief. It
was not Boone Morgan's purpose to start a
war—all he wanted was enough Monkey-wrench
cattle to pay the taxes, and a way to
get them out. The indications so far were
that Pecos had them in a bottle and was waiting
at the neck, but if the water ran down the
cañon there must be a hole somewhere, reasoned
the deputy, or better than that, a trail.
Working his way along the rim Bill Todhunter
finally spied the drift-fence across the box of
the cañon, and soon from his high perch he
was gazing down into that stupendous hole in
the ground that Pecos had turned into a pasture.
From the height of the towering cliffs
the cattle seemed like rabbits feeding in tiny
spots of green, but there they were, more than
a hundred of them, and when the deputy beheld
the sparkling waters of the Salagua below
them and the familiar pinnacles of the Superstitions
beyond he laughed and fell to whistling
"Paloma" through his teeth. Boone Morgan
had hunted Apaches in the Superstitions, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
he knew them like a book. With one man on
the rim-rocks to keep tab on Pecos, Boone and
his posse could take their time to it, if there
was any way to get in from that farther side.
Anyhow, he had located the cattle—the next
thing was to get word to the Old Man.</p>

<p>As a government scout Boone Morgan had
proved that he was fearless, but they did not
keep him for that—they kept him because he
brought his men back to camp, every time.
The effrontery of Pecos Dalhart's daring to
challenge his authority had stirred his choler,
but when Bill Todhunter met him at the river
and told him how the ground lay he passed up
the temptation to pot Pecos as he crawled out
of his hole in the rock, and rode for the lower
crossing of the Salagua. The trail which the
hardy revolutionist of Lost Dog Cañon was
guarding was, indeed, the only one on the
north side of the river. From the pasture
where his cows were hidden the Salagua passed
down a box cañon so deep and precipitous that
the mountain sheep could not climb it, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
even with his cowboy-deputies Boone Morgan
could hardly hope to run the Monkey-wrench
cows out over the peaks without drawing the
fire of their owner. But there was a trail—and
it was a bad one—that led across the desert
from the Salagua until it cut the old Pinal
trail, far to the south, and that historic highway
had led many a war party of Apaches through
the very heart of the Superstitions. East it
ran, under the frowning bastions of the great
mountain, and then northeast until it came out
just across the river from Pecos Dalhart's pasture.
It was a long ride—sixty miles, and
half of it over the desert—but the river was at
its lowest water, just previous to the winter
rains, and once there Boone Morgan felt certain
they could make out to cross the cattle.</p>

<p>"And mind you, boys," he said to his posse,
as they toiled up the wearisome grade, "don't
you leave a single cow in that pasture or I'm
going to be sore as a goat. The county pays
mileage for this, and the taxes will be a few
cents, too—but I'm going to put one rustler
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
out of business at the start by a hell-roaring
big sheriff's sale. I'm going to show some of
these Texas hold-ups that Arizona ain't no
cow-thief's paradise—not while old Boone's
on the job."</p>

<p>The second night saw them camped on the
edge of the river just across from the pasture,
and in the morning they crossed on a riffle,
every man with his orders for the raid. By
noon the cattle began to come down the valley,
tail up and running before the drive; not a
word was spoken, for each man knew his business,
but when the thirsty herd of Monkey-wrench
cows finally waded out into the river
to drink, a sudden rush of horsemen from behind
crowded the point animals into swimming
water, and before the leaders knew what had
happened they were half way across the river
and looking for a landing.</p>

<p>"<i>Ho—ho—ho—ho—ho!</i>" shouted the
sheriff, riding in to turn them upstream, and
behind him a chorus of cowboy yells urged the
last bewildered stragglers into the current.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
They crossed, cows and calves alike, and while
the jubilant posse came splashing after them
or rode howling up to the ford Boone Morgan
poured the water out of his boots and smiled
pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Jest hold 'em in the willows a while, boys,"
he said, "until they git quieted down and drink,
and then we'll hit the trail. There's over a
hundred head of cattle there, but I'm going to
sell every dam' one of 'em—sheriff's sale.
Then when that crazy Texican gets back on the
reservation I'll give him back his money—what's
left—along with some good advice."</p>

<p>He motioned to the boys to string the cattle
out and soon in a long line the much-stolen
Monkey-wrench cows were shambling over the
rough trail, lowing and bellowing for the
peaceful valley that lay empty of its herd.
From the high cliffs above Lost Dog Cañon,
Bill Todhunter saw the slow procession wending
its way toward town and he made haste
to follow its example. The old silence settled
down upon the valley of Perro Perdito, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
silence unbroken even by the lowing of cattle,
and as Pecos lay by his fire that night he felt
the subtle change. His mind, so long set
against his enemies, opened up, and he began to
wonder. Boone Morgan had certainly said he
would collect those taxes within a week, and
the week was up. Moreover, hiding in a wind-hole
from daylight till dark was getting decidedly
monotonous. From the beginning
Pecos had realized that he was one man against
many but he had hoped, by remaining hid, to
catch them at a disadvantage. If they
sneaked up and looked over into the lonely
cañon they might easily think he had fled and
come in boldly—but somehow nothing came
out as he had expected. He slept on the
matter, and woke again to that peculiar hushed
silence. What was it that he missed? His
horses were safe in their pole corral; Old
Funny-face and her speckled calf were still
hanging around the camp; the cattle were
along the creek as usual—ah, yes! It was
the lowing of cows against the drift-fence bars!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
With a vigorous kick he hurled his blanket
aside, stamped on his boots and ran, only stopping
to buckle on his six-shooter. At the
bars he paused long enough to see that there
were no fresh tracks and then dashed down the
pent-in gorge that led to the pasture rim.
The shadow of the high cliffs lay across the
sunken valley like a pall, but there were no
humped-up cattle sleeping beneath the trees.
It was time for them to be out and feeding
in the sun, but the meadows and hillsides were
bare. He was astounded and could not believe
his eyes—the pasture was empty as the
desert. Cursing and panting Pecos plunged
madly down the steep trail until he came to
the first water, and there he threw down his
gun and swore. Fresh and clean on the margin
of the water-hole was the track of a shod
horse, pointing toward the river! It was
enough—Pecos knew that he was cleaned!
Indians and mountain renegades do not ride
shod horses, and if Boone Morgan had his
cows across the river already he could never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
get them back. Another thought came to
Pecos, and he scrambled wildly up the trail
to defend his remaining herd, but there was
no one there to fight him—his upper cattle
were safe. Yet how long would it take to get
them, in order to finish him up? All Boone
Morgan and Upton had to do was to wait
until he went down to the store for provisions
and then they could rake his upper range the
same way. And would they do it? Well,
say! Pecos pondered on the matter for a day
or two, keeping mostly behind the shelter of
some rock, and the sinister import of Morgan's
remarks on what a government can do for a
certain class of people bore in upon him
heavily. Undoubtedly he was included in
that class of undesirables and if he was any
reader of character Boone Morgan was just
the kind of a man to make him a lot of trouble.
Upton was against him because he had stolen
his U cows, and Crit was against him worse
because he had given him the cross—every
cowman on the range would be against him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
because he was a rustler. Pecos watched the
rim-rock vindictively after that, hoping to get
a chance to pot some meddlesome cowman, but
no inquisitive head was poked over. At last
he stole up the ravine one morning and took to
the high ground at dawn. There, sure
enough, were the boot-marks among the rocks
and he noticed with a vague uneasiness that
some one had been watching him for days—watching
his wind-hole, too,—probably could
have shot him a hundred times, but now the
tracks were old. A hot and unreasonable resentment
rose up in Pecos at the implication.
Nobody cared for him now, even to the extent
of watching him! He could crawl into his
hole and die now, and everybody would just
laugh. Well, he would show Mr. Everybody
what kind of a sport he was. After which
circumlocuted reasoning Pecos Dalhart, the
bad man from Perro Perdito Cañon, being
really lonely as a dog, threw the saddle on his
horse and hit the trail for the Verde.</p>

<p class="ac">STAMPEDED</p>

<p class="drop-cap">FOR two weeks after Pecos Dalhart disappeared
into the wilderness Angevine
Thorne spent the greater part of his time sitting
in the doorway of the store with his eyes
fixed upon the tiny notch where the Carrizo
trail cut down through the mesa's rim. Never,
until that day when he had defied Boone Morgan,
had Angy realized the heroic devotion of
his comrade to the cause of the revolution, and
his heart was strong to help him, even at the
risk of his job. If Crit would only have let him
have a horse he would have gone to Lost Dog
Cañon long ago, to carry the news of Morgan's
raid and his subsequent visit to Verde Crossing
in search of Pecos, but lacking any means of
travel he had to be content to wait and watch
the trail. The two weeks passed drearily and
still, as each afternoon wore on, Babe seated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
himself in the shade of the brush <i>ramada</i> and
speculated upon the fate of Pecos. But in this
he was not alone. Early in the game Isaac
Crittenden had noted the set gaze of his
faithless roustabout, and though he still rode
out with his cowboys, he also managed to
keep his one eye cocked on the eastern
horizon, for he had interests in those parts.
There were a hundred head of Monkey-wrench
cattle still running loose in Lost
Dog Cañon, and that would make good pickings
if Pecos went over the road. As to what
particular road the cattle-rustler took, whether
to the pen or parts unknown, or to his home
on high, was immaterial to Isaac Crittenden,
providing always that he heard about it first.
A bunch of mavericks without an owner was
likely to get snapped up quick in those parts—John
Upton might turn out to be the lucky
man, but not if I. C. knew himself, and he
thought he did.</p>

<p>It is a long day's ride from Lost Dog
Cañon—dragging a pack-animal a man would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
get in about sundown—and as the days wore
on Crittenden made it a point to ride so that
he could cut the Carrizo trail between four
and five. This was a desperate game that he
was playing, for Pecos Dalhart was undoubtedly
in an ugly mood; but a little nerve will
carry a man a long way sometimes, and at a
pinch Crit could shoot a gun himself. So it
happened that on the day that Pecos rode to
the edge of the bench and sat looking down
doubtfully upon the distant Verde Crossing,
he heard a horse pounding in on his right and
finally made out Isaac Crittenden, in wild and
unnecessary pursuit of a cow. At a suitable
distance the cowman looked up, let his cow go,
and ambled cautiously over toward his former
agent. Holding his hands in sight to show
that his intentions were pacific, he came in
closer and at last motioned to Pecos to come
away from the mesa rim.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you?" he called,
frantically repeating his signal. "D' you want
to let Boone Morgan see you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>"Boone Morgan?" repeated Pecos, reining
in his horse. "Why—what—"</p>

<p>"Haven't you heard the news?" demanded
Crittenden, hectoringly. "Boone Morgan took
a hundred head of your Monkey-wrench
critters down the Pinal trail, and every
dam' one of 'em had been burnt over from
a U. He was up here inquirin' for you a
day or two ago."</p>

<p>Their eyes met and Pecos tried to pass it
off in bravado, but Crit had him at a disadvantage.
"The best thing you can do is
drift," he observed, meaningly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," said Pecos, "I got a
hundred head an' more of cows over in Lost
Dog Cañon yet. What'll you—"</p>

<p>"They ain't worth a dam'," cut in Crittenden,
harshly.</p>

<p>"No, I know they ain't," assented the cowboy,
patiently, "not to me—but to a man
with a big outfit they'd be worth about fifteen
hundred dollars."</p>

<p>"Well, <i>I</i> don't want 'em," snapped Crit.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
"I got troubles enough, already, without hidin'
out from Boone Morgan."</p>

<p>"I'll sell you that brand cheap," supplicated
Pecos, but the cowman only showed his teeth
in derision.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't take 'em as a gift," he said,
shortly.</p>

<p>"Well, go to hell, then!" snarled the rustler,
and jerking his horse around he started toward
Verde Crossing.</p>

<p>"Hey, where you goin'?" called Crittenden,
but Pecos did not reply. "You'll git into
trouble," he persisted, following anxiously
after him. "Say, do you want to break into
jail?"</p>

<p>Pecos halted on the rim of the mesa, turned
deliberately about and faced him.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "do you?"</p>

<p>"Why, what d' you mean?" demanded the
cowman, leaving off his blustering and coming
nearer.</p>

<p>"Well, if they throw me in I'll tell all I
know," replied Pecos. "That's all. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
may soak me for the Monkey-wrenches, but
I'll sure git you on them Wine-glasses, so you
better not try any funny business. What I'm
lookin' for now is travellin' expenses—I'm
not so stuck on this country that I couldn't
be induced to leave it!"</p>

<p>"No-o," sneered the cowman, "I don't
reckon you are. They ain't a man between
Tonto and the Gila that don't know you for
a rustler now. More 'n that, you've defied
the officers of the law. No, Mr. Dalhart," he
said, a cold glint coming into his eye, "I won't
give you a dam' cent for your burnt-over cattle
and if you take my advice you'll hit the
high places for New Mexico."</p>

<p>"Well, I won't take it, then," replied Pecos,
sullenly. "I'm goin' down to the Crossing
to see Angy and—hey! there's the old boy
now, flaggin' me from the store. Well, good-bye,
old Cock Eye, don't worry about me none,
I know my way around!" He favored his
former employer with a flaunting gesture of
farewell, leaned over to catch the forward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
jump of his horse, and went scampering down
the slope and across the level, yipping playfully
at every bound.</p>

<p>"Well, the blank-blanked fool!" exclaimed
Crittenden, slapping his leg viciously with his
quirt at this sudden wrecking of his hopes.
"Well, <i>dam'</i> 'im, for a proper eejit!" He
ground his teeth in vexation. "W'y, the
crazy dum-head!" he groaned, as the cloud of
dust receded. "Boone Morgan is shore to
come back to the Crossing to-night and catch
'im in the store! Him and that booze-fightin'
Angy—I got to git rid of him—but what in
the world am <i>I</i> goin' to do?"</p>

<p>From his station on the edge of the mesa he
could see the dust to the east where his cowboys
were bringing the day's beef-cut down to the
river and then, far up toward the northern
pass, a couple of horsemen jogging down the
Tonto trail. Boone Morgan rode a bay horse,
and one of these was solid color, but the other
rode an animal that showed a patch of white—looked
kind of familiar, too. He watched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
them until they showed up clear against a
clay-bank and then, making sure that the man
on the bay was Morgan, he spurred across the
flat to the store. Whatever happened, he
must be sure to get Pecos out of town, for
Upton had been talking Wine-glass to Morgan,
and they might summon him for a witness.</p>

<p>There was a sound of clanking glasses inside
the door as Crittenden rode up, and the
voice of Angevine Thorne, flamboyantly proclaiming
a toast.</p>

<p>"Then here's to the revolution," he ended
up, "and a pleasant journey to you, Cumrad,
wherever you go!"</p>

<p>They drank, and Crit, sitting outside on
his horse, slapped his thigh and laughed
silently. "A pleasant journey," eh? Well,
let it go at that and he would put up the
whiskey.</p>

<p>"You'll be sure and write me often," continued
Angy, caressingly, "and I'll send your
<i>Voice of Reason</i> to you, so you can keep up
with the times."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right, Pardner," answered Pecos, "but
say, give Marcelina my best and tell her I'll
be back in the spring. Tell 'er something
real nice for me, Angy, will you? Aw, to hell
with the cows; it'll be her I come back for!
Gittin' a little too warm for me right now,
but I'll be here when she comes home in the
spring. Well, let's take another drink to the
sweetest little girl that ever lived and then I'll
be on my way!" The glasses clicked again
and as Angy began another peroration Old
Crit pulled his horse around with an oath and
started up the road. So that was why he had
been turned down by Marcelina—Pecos was
making love to her while he was gone! And
he'd be back in the springtime, eh? Well, not
if there was room in the county jail and Boone
Morgan would take him down! Hot with his
new-made scheme for revenge he spurred his
horse to a gallop and was just swinging around
the first turn in the trail when he fetched up
face to face with Morgan and John Upton!</p>

<p>The world is full of hatred in a thousand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
forms but there is none more bitter than that
between two men who have seen a former
friendship turn to gall and wormwood. So
bitter was the enmity between Upton and Old
Crit that it needed but the time and occasion
to break out into a war. Short, freckle-faced,
and red-headed, with a week's growth of
stubby beard and a clear green eye, John
Upton was not a man that one would pick for
an enemy, and the single swift move that he
made toward his pistol expressed his general
sentiments plainer than any words. As for
Crittenden, his emotions were too badly mixed
to lead to action, but the one-eyed glare which
he conferred upon his cow-stealing rival convinced
Boone Morgan at a glance that Old
Crit was dangerous.</p>

<p>"I'd like to have a word with you, Mr. Crittenden,"
he said, taking command on the instant,
"and since Mr. Upton is interested in
this matter I have asked him to come along
down. We won't discuss the business I have
in hand until we get to town, but now that I've
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
got you two gentlemen together I'd like to
ask you to be a little more careful about your
branding. My deputies reported to me that
on the last round-up calves were found bearing
a different iron from their mothers and that
mavericks were branded on sight, anywhere on
the open range. The law provides, as you
know, that no cow-brute can be branded anywhere
except in a corral or at a round-up and
no man has the right to brand any maverick,
<i>orejano</i>, leppy, or sleeper except in the presence
and with the consent of witnesses. There
have been certain irregularities up here in the
past, as is to be expected in a new country,
but I want to tell you right now that in the future
I'm going to hold you cowmen to the law.
I was elected and sworn in to uphold the
peace and dignity of Geronimo County, so if
you have any little feuds or differences to
work off, I'll thank you to do it outside
my jurisdiction."</p>

<p>He paused, and as they rode down the broad
trail that merged into Verde's main street the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
rival cattle kings exchanged malignant glances
behind his broad and soldierly back. But the
sheriff's eyes were to the fore and at sight of
Pecos Dalhart's horse tied to the ground in
front of the store he chuckled to himself.</p>

<p>"Well, well," he said, reaching down into
his inside vest pocket, "I'm just in time to deliver
these papers—or am I mistaken in
thinking that that hoss yonder belongs to Mr.
Dalhart?" He glanced across at Crittenden,
who shrugged his shoulders and scowled.
"Quite correct, eh? Well, then, if you gentlemen
will excuse me for a moment I'll go in
and see Mr. Dalhart."</p>

<p>He swung down from his horse with military
precision and strode toward the door,
carrying a bulky official envelope in his left
hand and a cigar stump in his right, but just
as he crossed the threshold Pecos Dalhart,
startled by his voice, dodged out the back way
and ran around the store. It was a break for
liberty with him and he took no thought of
the cost. Three seconds after the sheriff entered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
the doorway he came tearing around the
corner, heading for his horse. At sight of
Upton and Old Crit he paused and reached
for his gun—for one tense moment they
glared at each other—then, flinging himself
into the saddle and hugging his horse's neck,
Pecos went spurring away down the trail,
reckless of everything but the one main chance
of escape.</p>

<p>"Hey! Wait a minute!" roared Boone
Morgan, dashing out the doorway and waving
his envelope. "Come back heah, you pore dam'
fool! Well, don't that beat the devil?" he inquired,
turning to Crit and Upton. "<i>I</i> didn't
have no warrant for him! No! I jest wanted—"
he paused and, noticing the wolfish eagerness
with which the cowmen awaited his final
words, he suddenly changed his mind. "Well,
what's the difference," he grumbled, tucking
the big envelope back into his pocket, "he'll
keep." He followed the cloud of dust that
stood for Pecos Dalhart until it tore up over
the rim of the mesa and disappeared, and a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
deep and subterranean rumbling in his chest
paid tribute to the joke. There was something
like a thousand dollars in that big official envelope—the
balance of the Monkey-wrench
tax sale—and all he wanted of Pecos was his
written receipt for the money.</p>

</div>

<p class="ac">THE CATTLE WAR</p>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Pecos Dalhart, flying from his
own evil conscience, went stampeding
out into the wilderness, Isaac Crittenden and
John Upton gazed after him with but a single
thought—who would get his cattle? With
Pecos out of the way, Crittenden saw a clear
field ahead of him in the Lost Dog country
and he joined Morgan in a throaty laugh, but
Upton viewed his mad flight with disappointment
and chagrin.</p>

<p>"Well, laugh then, you robber," he snarled,
turning angrily on Crit, "I s'pose it tickles
you to death to see that dam' cow-thief hit
the pike—he might talk and git you into
trouble. Say, Mr. Morgan," he protested,
"ain't you takin' quite a responsibility onto
yourself to let that man git away?—you know
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
what we came down here for," he added, jerking
his head toward Crit.</p>

<p>"Well, what did you come down here for,
you little sawed-off runt?" demanded Crittenden,
belligerently. "Hollerin' around, as
usual, I s'pose!"</p>

<p>"I come down here to find out about them
U cows of mine that you branded into a
Wine-glass," retorted Upton, "but you and the
sheriff here seem to have some kind of an
understandin', lettin' the principal witness git
away, and all that, so I reckon I better pull."</p>

<p>"Not before you eat them words, Mr. Upton,"
cut in the sheriff, fiercely. "I don't let
no man make insinuations like that about me
without callin' on him to retract—and I ain't
never been disappointed yet!"</p>

<p>"Well, you jest let that Dalhart feller git
away, didn't you?" demanded Upton, defiantly.</p>

<p>"I certainly did, sir," replied Boone Morgan,
with ponderous dignity, "and when you
git ready to start I shall accord you the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
courtesy! There are no papers out for Mr.
Dalhart and unless I detect him in some breach
of law or receive a warrant for his arrest I've
got no right to lay a finger on him. Now you
know very well I've got no understanding
with Crittenden, and I'm goin' to ask you to
apologize for that statement you jest made."</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't mean no offence," protested
the cowman, meekly, "and I apologize,
all right—but at the same time it don't seem
right to let that dam' cattle-rustler git away
like that."</p>

<p>"No," responded the sheriff, with heavy sarcasm,
"it don't. But bein' as he's gone you
<i>cowmen</i> will have a chance to show what good
citizens <i>you</i> are. I don't know jest what Mr.
Dalhart's plans are, but when it comes around
to the spring round-up I want to find every
one of them Monkey-wrench cattle <i>thar</i>!
He's paid his taxes in full and he's entitled
to the full protection of the law, so long as he
keeps the peace. You hear me talking, now;
this brand-burnin' has gone far enough."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>"But how about them U cows I lost?" put in
Upton, pertinently. "Do Crit and this Pecos
Dalhart git to keep all the critters they stole?"</p>

<p>"Stole, nothin'!" retorted Crittenden hotly.
"How about them J I C cows of yourn?"</p>

<p>"You make a business of burnin' my brand!"
rejoined Upton, shaking his finger threateningly.
"You hire men to rob me and rake my
whole upper range! I'm losin' more now
than I did when the Apaches was in the hills;
but I'll git even with you yet, you dam',
humped-back old cow-thief!"</p>

<p>"Well, I see you gentlemen are goin' to keep
on quarrellin'," observed Boone Morgan, picking
up his bridle-rein, "and I might as well go
on about my business. You got no more
respect for the law, either one of you, than a
common cattle-rustler, and I'm goin' to quit
wrastlin' with you, right now. But you can
cut this out and paste it in your hats—the first
man that steals a cow in Geronimo County, and
I catch 'im, is goin' to git the limit. Angy,
gimme a bag of crackers and some of that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
jerked beef—I'm tired of hearin' this
yawp."</p>

<p>So genuine was his disgust that Boone Morgan
plunged through the cold river at nightfall
and took the long trail for Geronimo, but
the memory of his last words lingered in the
minds of the warring cowmen for many a day,
and though Pecos Dalhart was known to be over
in New Mexico somewhere his Monkey-wrench
herd remained safe in Lost Dog Cañon. As
for the sheriff, having abandoned all idea of
peace, he transacted his business in the mountains
by deputy and sat quiet in Geronimo,
waiting only for the first break to come back
and make his word good. It had a wonderful
restraining influence upon Crit and Upton,
this prolonged and ominous absence, but as
spring came on and the new crop of calves
began to gambol on the mesas, the old spirit
of grab rose up and overleapt the dull fear of
last winter. Once more both Crit and Upton
began to take on nervy cowboys—men who
by their boasts or by their silence let it be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
known that they were game—and the cow-camp
at Verde Crossing sheltered gun-men
from all over the Far West. From the Tonto
country there came rumors that Upton was
bringing in bad men from Pleasant Valley,
fresh from the bloody combats where the Grahams
and Tewkesburys met. Bill Todhunter
rode in when the round-up was well begun and
looked the outfits over with grave unconcern,
dropping out of sight on the trail and turning
up at Geronimo two days later to report that
all was well in Lost Dog Cañon. There were
no deputy sheriffs in disguise on this round-up—both
Crittenden and Upton satisfied themselves
of that early in the day—and as the
work went on and the lust for spoils grew with
each branded maverick, the war spirit crept in
and grew apace.</p>

<p>Ike Crittenden was the first to renew the
feud—he came across an old ICU cow and
branded her to ICU2. One of Upton's range
riders picked her up after the branding and
Upton promptly altered the brand on an IC
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
cow, to break even. Then came the grand
<i>coup</i> for which Crittenden had long been preparing.
On the morning after Upton took
his revenge, the whole IC outfit—forty
cowboys and every man armed—went galloping
over the Carrizo trail to Lost Dog
Cañon. By noon they had gathered every
animal in the valley; at night they camped with
the herd at Carrizo Springs; and the next day
every Monkey-wrench cow was safe in the
Verde corrals with her Monkey-wrench burnt
to a Spectacle (<img src="images/i_162.jpg"
        alt="Cattle brand in the shape of eyeglasses." />) and her ears chopped down
to her head. The ear-marks having been altered
once already there was nothing for it but
to make the new marks deeper and more inclusive—swallow-fork
the left and crop the
right. The swallow-fork was deep in the left,
to take in an underbit that Pecos had cut, and
Old Funny-face, who had returned home with
the herd, lost the fancy Mexican window and
<i>anzuelo</i> in her right ear altogether, along with
all other signs of a former ownership. But
even then the artistic knife-work of José Garcia
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
was not allowed to perish from the earth.
As Funny-face rose up from this last indignity
and menaced the perspiring cowboys with her
horns, the little Garcia children, hanging over
the fence, dashed out through the dust and
turmoil and rescued the close-cropped ears.
Already, in spite of threats and admonitions,
they had gathered quite a collection of variegated
crops and swallow-forks to serve as play-cows
in their toy corral; but when Marcelina
came upon this last bloody evidence of the
despite that was shown her lover she snatched
the ears away and hid them in the thatched
roof. Old Funny-face was Pecos's cow—she
knew that as well as she knew the red-spotted,
dun-colored ears that had adorned her
speckled head. Pecos had bought Funny-face
and her calf from her father for thirty dollars,
to keep around his camp to milk, and now
there was nothing to show for his ownership
but the ears. But perhaps Pecos would be
glad even for them, if ever he came back. In
a letter to Babe he had said he was coming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
back, now that the sheriff was his friend. But
Crit—ha-ah, Ol' Creet—he was stealing all
of Pecos's cows, and the sheriff did not care!
She stood by a post of the brush <i>ramada</i> and
scowled at him as he raged about on his horse,
cursing and shouting and waving his arms and
hurrying his men along. He was a bad man—ahr,
how she hated him—and now he was
such a thief!</p>

<p>As the quick work of branding was brought
to an end and the herd driven pell-mell down
the river and into the heavy willows, the Boss
of Verde Crossing sent half of his cowboys
down to guard them and began to clean up the
corral. First he put out the fires and quenched
the hot running-irons and rings; then he removed
the branding outfit, dug a deep hole in
the river-bed and set his men to work in details,
gathering up the clipped ears and swallow-forks
from the trampled dirt of the corral. A
single ear left lying would be a record
of his theft, and when one of the Garcia <i>niños</i>,
by an ill-timed dash for more ears, set Crit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
upon the trail of their play cows he rushed in
and ravished all their toy corrals, even though
Marcelina stood by the <i>ramada</i> and curled her
lip at his haste.</p>

<p>"You will rob even the cheeldren, Meester
Creet!" she remarked, as he dumped them all
into his hat.</p>

<p>"Mind your own business!" he answered,
sharply, and scuttled away like a crab, bearing
his plunder with him.</p>

<p>"Ah, you ba-ad man!" observed Marcelina,
making faces at his bent back. "I hope Paycos
come back and <i>keel</i> you!"</p>

<p>But Isaac Crittenden was not worrying
about any such small fry as Pecos Dalhart.
Boone Morgan and John Upton were the men
he had on his mind and it was about time for
Upton to show up. A solitary horseman, high
up on the shoulder of the peaks, had watched
their departure from Carrizo Springs that
morning, and if Upton had not known before
he certainly knew very well now that the
Monkey-wrench brand was no more. As for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
Boone Morgan—well, there was an IC cow
in the corral, altered by John Upton to JIC,
and it was just as big a crime to steal one cow
as it was to steal a hundred. One thing was
certain, no man from the IC outfit would call
on the sheriff for aid; and if Upton was the
red-headed terror that he claimed to be, the
matter would be settled out of court.</p>

<p>In this particular incident Mr. Crittenden
was more than right. The matter was already
adjudicated by range law, and entirely to the
satisfaction of Upton. For while Crit was
hustling his Monkey-wrench herd over to
Verde Crossing, the U outfit—also forty
strong—had hopped over the shoulder of the
Peaks, rounded up every Wine-glass cow that
they could gather, and were at that moment
busily engaged at Carrizo Springs in altering
them to a Circle-cross (<img src="images/i_166.jpg"
        alt="Brand in the shape of a female gender symbol." />). It made a very
pretty brand too; but after studying on it for
a while and recalling his past experience with
Crit, Upton decided to play safe and make it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
a double cross (<img src="images/i_167.jpg"
        alt="Brand in the shape of circle with a double cross." />). No more ICU2's for
John Upton—he had been there once—and
Circle Double-cross it went on every animal
they marked. The next morning, with every
cow and calf well in hand, the U boys began
to drift the Circle Double-cross herd back over
the mountain, and just as Crittenden was marshalling
his fighting men to win back the
ravished stock there was a clatter of hoofs down
at the Crossing and Boone Morgan rode into
camp, followed by a posse of deputies.</p>

<p>"Well, what's the trouble up here, Mr. Crittenden?"
he inquired, glancing with stern displeasure
at the armed men who gathered about
their chief. "Is there an Injun uprisin' or have
you gone on the warpath yourse'f?"</p>

<p>"You jest come down to my corral," spat
back Crittenden, "and I'll show you what's
the matter! That low-lived John Upton has
been burnin' my brand!" He led the way at
a gallop to where the IC cow that had been altered
to JIC was tied by the horns to a post.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
"You see that brand?" he inquired, "well, that
was made three days ago by John Upton—you
can see the J is still raw."</p>

<p>"Umph!" grunted the sheriff, after a careful
scrutiny of the brand, "did anybody see him
do it?"</p>

<p>"No, but he done it, all right!"</p>

<p>"Would you swear to it? Can you prove
it? How do you know somebody else didn't
do it?"</p>

<p>"No, I can't swear to it—and I can't prove
it, neither—but one of my boys picked that
cow up three days ago right in the track of
Upton's outfit, and, knowin' the little whelp as
I do, I don't need no lawyer's testimony to
make a case!"</p>

<p>"Well, I do," replied Boone Morgan, resolutely,
"and I don't want this to go any further
until I get the facts! What you goin' to
do with all those two-gun cowboys?"</p>

<p>"I'm goin' to take over the mesa after John
Upton and his dam', cow-stealin' outfit," cried
Crittenden, vehemently, "and if you're lookin'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
for legal evidence, he went out of Carrizo
Springs this mornin' drivin' nigh onto two
hundred head of Wine-glass cows, as one of
my boys jest told me. Law, nothin'!" shouted
the cowman, recklessly. "I ain't goin' to sit
around here, twiddlin' my fingers, and waitin'
for papers and evidence! What I want is
action!"</p>

<p>"Well, you'll get it, all right," replied Morgan,
"and dam' quick, too, if you think you
can run it over me! I want you to understand,
Mr. Crittenden, that I am the sheriff of this
county, and the first break you make to go
after John Upton I'll send you down to Geronimo
with the nippers on, to answer for resisting
an officer! Now as for these men of
yours, I give every one of 'em notice, here and
now, that I want this racket to stop, and the
first man that goes up against me will wind up
in the county jail. Bill," he continued, turning
to his trusted deputy, "I leave you in
charge of this layout while I go after John
Upton. Keep the whole outfit in camp until
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
I come back, if you have to kill 'em. I've got
enough of this."</p>

<p>He rode down to the store with his posse,
bought a feed of grain for his horses and
provisions for his men, and half an hour
afterward went galloping out the Carrizo
trail, his keen eye scanning the distant
ridges and reading the desert signs like a book.
It did not take an Indian trailer to interpret
the deep-trampled record of that path. Two
days before a big herd of cows and calves had
come into Verde Crossing from Carrizo, driven
by many shod horses and hustled along in a
hurry. As he approached Carrizo fresher
tracks cut across the old signs, the tracks of
cows and calves fleeing from scampering
ponies, and at the Springs the fresh signs
closed in and trampled out all evidence of the
old drive. It was the last page of the story,
written indelibly in the sandy earth. On the
open <i>parada</i> ground the cropped ears had all
been gathered, but the bruised bushes, the
blood and signs of struggle told the plain story
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
of Upton's branding, just as the vacancy of
the landscape and the long trail leading to the
north spelled the material facts of the drama.
The Wine-glass cows that used to be about
Carrizo Springs were gone—John Upton had
driven them north. But why? The answer
lay beyond Carrizo Springs, where the white
trail leads down from Lost Dog Cañon.
There the trampled tracks that led into Verde
Crossing stood out plain again in the dust—three
days old and pressed on by hurrying
horses. If the law could accept the record of
Nature's outspread book Crit and Upton were
condemned already, the one for stealing Pecos
Dalhart's herd, the other for branding over the
Wine-glasses. But the law demands more
than that. It demands evidence that a lawyer
can read; the sworn testimony of honest and
unprejudiced witnesses; the identification of
men, brands, and cows, proved beyond a doubt;
and all this in a country where all cows look
alike, all witnesses are partisans, and an honest
man is the noblest work of God. Boone Morgan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
took up the long trail to the north with
fire in his eye, and he rode furiously, as was
his duty, but deep down in his heart he knew
he was after the wrong man, and would not
even get him.</p>

   <h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>
</div>

<p class="ac">MOUNTAIN LAW</p>

<p class="drop-cap">AS the sheriff's posse spurred their tired
horses up the long slope of the rocky
mountain and down into the rough country beyond,
the trail grew fresher with every hour,
until the blood from mutilated ears showed
wet in the trampled dirt. But as the herd
made its way into the broken ground the heavy
trail split up and divided; at each fork of the
cañon a bunch was cut off from the drag of
the herd and drifted by a hand or two down
onto the lower range, and when at last the trail
broke out into the open country again the
posse was following the tracks of only three
men and twenty or thirty cows. Then they
picked up a stray, burned clean into a Circle-Double-cross
and freshly ear-marked, and
after that the remnant of the band, standing
wearily by a water-hole. Every one of them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
had been freshly branded with a hot iron—no
hair-brand or attempt at burning through
a sack—and half of their ears were bloody
from being torn in the brush; but there were
no cowboys loitering near, waiting to be
caught with the goods. The horse-tracks still
led on until at last they scattered out and
mounted the neighboring ridges. But if the
trail was lost there were other signs to lead
Morgan on his way. The sun was hanging
low now, and their horses were jaded from
hard riding, but at the familiar bellowing of
a cow-herd they pricked up their ears and
forged ahead. The valley opened out suddenly
before them and there on their regular
<i>parada</i> grounds was the entire U outfit, holding
a big herd and cutting, roping, and branding
by days' works. Innocence and industry
were the twin watchwords in that aggregation—they
were too busy even to look up—and
when Boone Morgan saw the game he rode
past them without speaking and tackled the
cook for supper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>"Boys are workin' kinder late to-night, ain't
they?" he observed, filling his plate from the
Dutch ovens.</p>

<p>"Sure are," answered the cook, sententiously.
He had caught a glimpse of a star on a deputy's
vest, and his orders were not to talk.</p>

<p>"Can't even stop to eat, hey?" continued the
sheriff, nodding at an ovenful of cold biscuits
that had been wastefully thrown in the dirt.
"Well, that's a pity, too, because you sure do
make good bread. But a sour-dough biscuit
ain't never no good unless it's eaten fresh."</p>

<p>"No," grumbled the cook, taken off his
guard, "and ef they's anything I do despise
it is to cook up a good oven of bread and then
have it spile thataway."</p>

<p>"Well, we're certainly appreciatin' this
batch," remarked Morgan, glancing genially
around at his busy men. "The boys bein' away
yesterday kind of threw you out, I reckon."</p>

<p>"Thet's right," agreed the cook, oblivious
of his intent, "I hed a big kittle of beans spile
on me, too."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>"They'll sure be hungry when they do hit
camp," said the sheriff, continuing his lead,
"livin' on cold grub that way. Hello," he exclaimed,
looking up as John Upton came hurrying
in, "here comes Mr. Upton now—ganted
down to a shadow."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know!" replied Upton, guardedly,
"b'lieve I could eat a little, though."</p>

<p>"Well, I reckon you ought to," said Morgan,
"after goin' two days on cold grub."</p>

<p>"Cold grub!" repeated the cowman, glancing
at the cook.</p>

<p>"Why, sure. And that's a long, hard ride
over to Carrizo, too." The sheriff took a big
mouthful and waited.</p>

<p>"What in hell you talkin' about?" demanded
the cowman, sullenly.</p>

<p>"Why, wasn't you over to Carrizo yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Nope."</p>

<p>"And never eat no cold grub?" inquired
the sheriff, gazing quizzically toward Joe, the
cook.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dam' yore heart, Joe!" burst out Upton,
looking daggers at the startled pot-tender,
"have you been blabbin' already?"</p>

<p>"That'll be all, Mr. Upton," said Boone
Morgan, quietly, "I'm up here lookin' for the
owner of this new Circle Double-cross brand.
Is that your iron? It is? Well, I'll have to
ask you to go back with me to-morrow and explain
where them cows come from."</p>

<p>"Well, by the holy—jumpin'—" The cowman
paused in his wrath and fixed his fiery eyes
on Boone Morgan. "Did Ike Crittenden put
you up to this?" he demanded, and taking silence
for consent he went off into a frenzy of indignation.
"Well, what you chasin' <i>me</i> for?"
he yelled, choking with exasperation. "Old
Crit goes over into Lost Dog and runs off
every dam' one of them Monkey-wrench cows,
and you come right through his camp and
jump <i>me</i>! They wasn't a critter in Lost Dog
that hadn't been burnt over my U, and you
know it; but ump-um—Crit's a friend of
mine—never make him any trouble—go over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
and tackle Upton—he's a <i>Tonto</i> County
man!"</p>

<p>The sheriff listened to this tirade with a tolerant
smile, feeding himself liberally the while.
He had long ago learned that the world's supply
of self-righteousness is not held in monopoly
by the truly good—also that every horse
must go to the length of his picket rope before
he will stop and eat. But when the fireworks
were over he remarked by way of conversation,
"Crit's got one of your JIC cows down there
in his corral—a red three, bald-faced and
kind of spotted on the shoulders. Looks like it
had been branded lately."</p>

<p>"Yes, an' I've got one of his ICU2's down
in my corral," retorted Upton, "and it sure has
been branded lately—you could smell the
burnt hair when I picked it up five days ago.
They ain't a man in my outfit that don't know
that old cow for an ICU, too."</p>

<p>"Um," commented Morgan, "you think he
stole it, hey?"</p>

<p>"I know it!" replied Upton, with decision.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
"You can see her yoreself, down in my headquarters
corral, and I picked her up in the
track of Crit's round-up."</p>

<p>"Well, you better swear out a warrant, then,
and we'll take the cow down for evidence.
You were hintin' that I'm standin' in with
Crittenden, but jest swear to a complaint and
see how quick I'll serve the papers."</p>

<p>For a moment the cowman cocked his head
and regarded him shrewdly—then he shook
his head. "I've got too much loose stock runnin'
on his range," he said.</p>

<p>"I'll protect your property," urged the
sheriff. "Come on, now—quit your kickin'
and make a complaint."</p>

<p>"Nope—too dangerous! I can take care
of myself in the hills, but if them Geronimo
lawyers ever git holt of me I'm done for.
You can take me down to-morrer, if you want
to, but I'd rather stick to my own game."</p>

<p>"All right," said the sheriff, "we'll see what
Crit will do."</p>

<p>There was a big crowd around the store
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
at Verde Crossing when Boone Morgan and
his posse rode in, and at sight of John Upton
by his side there was a general craning of necks
on the part of Crittenden's cowboys. This
was the first time that a sheriff had attempted
to stop the lawless raids and counter-raids of
these two cattle kings and the gun-men looked
upon him with disfavor, for even a professional
bad man is jealous of his job. An appeal to
the courts would divert their extra wages into
the pockets of the lawyers—it would dock
their pay and double their work, and to a man
they were against it. Yet here came Upton
with the sheriff, and Bill Todhunter had already
spotted some Spectacle cows that had
drifted back to the corrals. As for Crit, his
nerve was good, for he felt the fighting courage
of his men behind him, and he went out to
meet his ancient enemy with a taunting sneer.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad to see one man git what's
comin' to him," he observed, taking note of
Upton's guard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," retorted Upton, caustically, "and if
I'd jest tell a half of what I know, you'd be
mixin' 'dobes down at the Pen."</p>

<p>"Uhr!" grunted Crittenden, turning away
in scorn; but at the same time he took his cue
from the words.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Crittenden," began Morgan,
"here's the man you wanted so bad. Now if
you'll jest step into the store and fill out this
complaint—"</p>

<p>"Nothin' like that—nothin' like that!" protested
the Verde Boss, holding up his hand.
"I never said I wanted him arrested!"</p>

<p>"No, but you took me down and showed me
that JIC cow and said he stole it, didn't you?
And you complained to me that he was in the
act of runnin' off your Wine-glass cows, didn't
you? Well, that's the same thing, when
you're talkin' to an officer."</p>

<p>"Well, it may be all the same, but I don't
want 'im arrested. That ain't the way I do
business."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, it ain't, hey? Well, what is your way
of doin' business?"</p>

<p>"First principle is never to holler for help,"
replied Crittenden, grimly. "I know dam' well
that little cuss over there burnt my IC cow and
run off all my Wine-glasses—but I can't
prove nothin' before the law, so you might as
well turn 'im loose. Oh, you don't need to
laugh, you little, sawed-off runt!" he yelled,
addressing himself to Upton, "I'm jest
keepin' you out of jail so's I can git at you
myself! I'll—"</p>

<p>"Aw, shut up," growled the sheriff, brushing
roughly past him. "Come on, boys, let's
get out of this before they holler their heads
off." He swung angrily up on his horse,
jerked its head toward the river and took the
crossing in silence, leaving the rival cattle
kings to fight it out together. The time might
come when one or the other of them would
"holler for help," but just at that moment the
Verde country was not educated up to the law.</p>

<p class="ac">WELCOME HOME</p>

<p class="drop-cap">AFTER the war of words was over and
the tumult and shouting had died away,
the Angel of Peace, which had been flying
high of late, fluttered down and hovered low
over Verde Crossing. John Upton rode back
up the Tonto trail still breathing forth hostile
threats; Crittenden and his men buckled on
their extra guns and rode blithely out to the
adventure; and the store, from being a general
hang-out for noisy and drunken cowboys, became
once more a shrine to Venus and a temple
of the Muse, with Babe the minstrel and Marcelina
the devotee. "Billy Veniro" was the
theme—that long, sad tale of the far frontier—sung
in tragic tenor to a breathless
audience of one. She was very pretty, the
little Marcelina, now that she had become a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
woman. The Sisters had taught her her catechism
and something more—the grace and
sweetness that come from religious adoration,
and the quiet of the cell. The great world,
too, as personated by Geronimo, had done its
share; her hair was done up in dark masses,
her long skirt swept the floor, and with the
added dignity of a train her womanhood was
complete. She sat by the door where she
could watch the Tonto trail—for it was by
that road that Pecos was to come—and her
melancholy eyes glowed as she listened to the
song.</p>

    <div class="stanza">

<p>"Ay, <i>los</i> Ah-paches!" sighed Marcelina,
looking wistfully up the trail. "No <i>ai</i> Ah-paches
in mountains now, Babe?"</p>

<p>"No, Marcelina," soothed Angy, "all gone
now. Soldiers watch 'em—San Carlos."</p>

<p>"<i>Que malo, los Indios!</i>" shuddered Marcelina.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
"I am afraid—<i>quien sabe?</i>—who can
tell?—I am afraid some bad men shall keel—ah,
when say Paycos, he will come?"</p>

<p>"'I'll come a-runnin'—watch for my dust'—that's
all he wrote when I told him you was
home. Can't you see no dust nor nothin'?"</p>

<p>"There is leetle smoke, like camp-fire, up the
valley—and Creet's vaqueros come home
down Tonto trail. Pretty soon sundown—nobody
come."</p>

<p>Angevine Thorne stepped through the doorway
and, shading his bloodshot eyes with a
grimy hand, gazed long at the column of thin
smoke against the northern sky. "Like as not
some one is brandin' an <i>orejano</i>" he said, half
to himself. "Might even be Pecos, makin' a
signal fire. Hey, look at them bloody cowboys,
ridin' in on it! Look at 'em go down
that <i>arroyo</i>; will you? Say—I hope—"</p>

<p>"Hope what?"</p>

<p>"Well, I hope Pecos don't come across
none of them Spectacle cows on the way in—that's
all."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ahh, Paycos weel be mad—he weel—<i>Mira!</i>
Look, look!"</p>

<p>A furious mob of horsemen came whirling
down the trail, crowding about a central object
that swayed and fought in their midst;
they rushed it triumphantly into the open,
swinging their ropes and shouting, and as the
rout went by Angy saw Pecos, tied to his horse,
his arms bound tight to his sides and a myriad
of tangled reatas jerking him about in his
saddle.</p>

  <div class="caption">As the rout went by Angy saw Pecos, tied to his horse,

</div>

<p>"Hang the cow-thief!" howled the cowboys,
circling and racing back, and all the time Pecos
strained and tugged to get one hand to his
gun. Then his wild eyes fell on Marcelina and
he paused; she held out her hands, and Angy
rushed behind the bar for his gun.</p>

<p>"Here, what the hell you mean?" he yelled,
breaking from the door. "Quit jerkin' him
around like that, or I'll knock you off your
horse!" He ran straight through the crowd,
belting every horse he met with the barrel of
his forty-five, until he brought up with his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
back to Pecos and his pistol on the mob. "Let
go that rope, you—!" he cried, bringing his
six-shooter to a point, and as the nearest cowboy
threw loose and backed away he shifted
his gun to another. "Throw off your dally,"
he commanded, "and you too, you low-flung
Missouri hound! Yes, I mean you!" he
shouted, as Crit still held his turns. "What
right have you got to drag this man about?
I'll shoot the flat out of your eye, you old
dastard, if you don't let go that rope!"</p>

<p>Old Crit let go, but he stood his ground with
a jealous eye on his prize.</p>

<p>"Don't you tech them ropes," he snarled
back, "or I'll do as much for you. I caught
him in the act of stealin' one of my cows
and—"</p>

<p>"You <i>did</i> not!" broke in Pecos, leaning back
like a wing-broke hawk to face his exultant
foe, "that calf was mine—and its mother to
boot—and you go and burn it to a pair of
Spectacles! Can't a man vent his own calf
when it's been stole on 'im durin' his absence?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
Turn me loose, you one-eyed cow-thief, or I'll
have yore blood for this!"</p>

<p>"You don't git loose from me—not till the
sheriff comes and takes you to the jug. Close
in here, boys, and we'll tie him to a tree."</p>

<p>"Not while I'm here!" replied Angy, stepping
valiantly to the front. "They don't a
man lay a finger on 'im, except over my dead
body. You'll have to kill me—or I'll pot
Old Crit on you, in spite of hell!" He threw
down on his boss with the big forty-five and at
a sign from Crit the cowboys fell back and
waited.</p>

<p>"Now, lookee here, Angy," began Crittenden,
peering uneasily past the gun, "I want you
to keep yore hand outer this. Accordin' to
law, any citizen has a right to arrest a man
caught in the act of stealin' and I claim that
feller for my prisoner."</p>

<p>"Well, you don't git 'im," said Angy,
shortly. "What's the row, Pecos?"</p>

<p>Pecos Dalhart, still leaning back like a crippled
hawk that offers beak and claws to the foe,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
shifted his hateful eyes from Crittenden and
fixed them on his friend.</p>

<p>"I was ridin' down the <i>arroyo</i>," he said, "a
while ago, when I came across my old milk
cow that I bought of Joe Garcia." He paused
and gulped with rage. "One ear was cropped
to a grub," he cried, "and the other swallow-forked
to 'er head—and her brand was fresh
burnt to a pair of hobbles! The calf carried
the same brand and while I was barring them
Spectacles or Hobbles, or whatever you call
'em, and putting a proper Monkey-wrench in
their place, this pack of varmints jumped in
and roped me before I could draw a gun,
otherwise they would be some dead."</p>

<p>"Nothin' of the kind!" shouted back Crittenden.
"You never bought a cow in your life,
and you know it! I caught you in the act of
stealin' my Spectacle calf and I've got witnesses
to prove it—ain't that so, boys?"</p>

<p>"Sure!" chimed the IC cowboys, edging in
behind their boss.</p>

<p>"And I demand that man for my prisoner!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
he concluded, though pacifically, for Angy
still kept his bead.</p>

<p>The negotiations for the custody of Pecos
were becoming heated when there was a familiar
clatter at the ford and Bill Todhunter
rode into camp. His appearance was not such
an accident as on the surface appeared, since
he had been scouting around the purlieus of
Verde Crossing for some days in the hope of
catching Old Crit in some overt act, but he
put a good face on it and took charge of the
prisoner at once. Prisoners were the fruits of
his profession, like game to a hunter or mavericks
to a cowman, and he pulled the gun
out of Pecos's holster and threw loose the
tangled ropes with the calm joy of a man who
has made a killing.</p>

<p>"Caught 'im in the act, did ye?" he said, turning
to Crittenden. "Uh-huh—got any witnesses?
All right—where's the calf? Well,
send a man up for it, and bring the cow down,
too. We'll have a preliminary examination
before the J. P. to-morrow and I want that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
cow and calf for evidence. Now come on, Mr.
Dalhart, and remember that anything you say
is liable to be used against ye."</p>

<p>Denying and protesting, Pecos did as he
was bid; and, still denying his guilt, he went
before the magistrate in Geronimo. Crittenden
was there with his cowboys; the calf
was there with his barred brand and bloody
ears—and as the examination progressed
Pecos saw the meshes of a mighty net closing
relentlessly in upon him. In vain he protested
that the calf was his—Isaac Crittenden,
the cowman, swore that the animal belonged
to him and his cowboys swore to it after him.
In vain he called upon José Garcia to give witness
to the sale—Joe was in debt to the Boss
several hundred dollars and Old Funny-face,
the cow, was being hazed across the range by a
puncher who had his orders. His written bill
of sale was lost, the mother with her brands
and vents was gone, and a score of witnesses
against him swore to the damning fact that he
had been taken red-handed. After hearing all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
the evidence the Justice of the Peace consulted
his notes, frowned, and held the defendant for
the action of the grand jury. The witnesses
filed out, the court adjourned, and a representative
assemblage of cowmen congratulated
themselves, as law-abiding citizens of Geronimo
County, that there was one less rustler in
the hills. At last, after holding up her empty
scales for years, the star-eyed Goddess of
Justice was vindicated; the mills of the law had
a proper prisoner to work upon now and
though they were likely to grind a little slow—the
grand jury had just adjourned and would
not be convened again until fall—they were
none the less likely to be sure. Fortunately for
the cause of good government the iron hand of
the law had closed down upon a man who had
neither money, friends, nor influence, and
everybody agreed that he should be made an
awful example.</p>

<p class="ac">THE KANGAROO COURT</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE are some natures so stern and
rugged that they lean against a storm
like sturdy, wind-nourished pines, throwing
back their arms, shaking their rough heads,
and making strength from the elemental strife.
Of such an enduring breed was Pecos Dalhart
and as he stood before the judge, square-jawed,
eagle-eyed, with his powerful shoulders
thrown back, he cursed the law that held him
more than the men who had sworn him into
jail. But behind that law stood every man
of the commonwealth, and who could fight
them all, lone-handed? Lowering his head
he submitted, as in ancient days the conquered
barbarians bowed to the Roman yoke, but
there was rebellion in his heart and he resolved
when the occasion offered to make his dream
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
of the revolution a waking reality. The
deputy who led him over to jail seemed to
sense his prisoner's mood and left him strictly
alone, showing the way in silence until they
entered the sheriff's office.</p>

<p>The reception room to the suite of burglar-proof
apartments familiarly known as the
Hotel de Morgan was a spacious place,
luxuriously furnished with lounging chairs
and cuspidors and occupied at the moment by
Boone Morgan, a visiting deputy, three old-timers,
and a newspaper reporter. The walls
were decorated with a galaxy of hard-looking
pictures labelled "Escaped" and "Reward,"
many of which had written across their face
"Caught," and some "Killed"; there was a
large desk in the corner, a clutter of daily
papers on the floor, and the odor of good cigars.
Upon the arrival of Pecos Dalhart the sheriff
was engaged in telling a story, which he finished.
Then he turned in his swivel-chair,
sorted out a pen and opened a big book on the
desk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Dalhart, I believe," he said, smiling a
little grimly.</p>

<p>Pecos grunted, and the deputy taking the
cue, began a systematic search of his pockets.</p>

<p>"Grand larceny—held for the grand jury,"
he supplemented, and the sheriff wrote it
down in the book thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Sorry I can't give you the bridal chamber,
Mr. Dalhart," he continued, "but it's occupied
by a check-raiser; and I wouldn't think
of puttin' a cowman in the jag-cell with all
them sheep-herders—so I'll have to give you
Number Six, on the first floor front. Pretty
close quarters there now, but you'll have all the
more company on that account, and I'll guarantee
the boys will make you welcome." He
paused and winked at the reporter, who sharpened
a pencil and laughed. Boone Morgan's
Kangaroo Court was a local institution which
gave him a great deal of josh copy in the
course of a year and he lit a cigar and waited
to observe Pecos Dalhart's reception. The
kangaroo <i>alcalde</i> or judge was a horse-thief,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
the sheriff was a noted strong-arm man from
the East, the district attorney was an ex-lawyer
taking a graduate course in penology,
and altogether they made a very taking
<i>dramatis personæ</i> for little knockdown skits
on court-house life.</p>

<p>"Mr. Pecos Dalhart, cowman and brand-expert
extraordinary, is down from the Verde
for a few days and is stopping at the Hotel de
Morgan pending the action of the grand jury
in regard to one spotted calf alleged to have
been feloniously and unlawfully taken from
Isaac Crittenden, the cattle king. In the
absence of the regular reception committee,
Michael Slattery, the kangaroo sheriff, conducted
Mr. Dalhart before his honor the
alcalde who welcomed him in a neat speech
and conferred upon him the freedom of the
city. After a delightful half-hour of rough-house
the entire company sat down to a choice
collation of fruit provided by the generosity
of the guest of honor."</p>

<p>Something like that would go very well and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
be good for the drinks in half the saloons in
town. Only, of course, he must not forget to
put in a little puff about the sheriff—"Sheriff
Morgan is very proud of the excellent order
maintained in the county jail," or something
equally acceptable.</p>

<p>The deputy continued his search of Pecos
Dalhart's person, piling money, letters, jack-knife,
and trinkets upon the desk and feeling
carefully along his coat lining and the bulging
legs of his boots—but Pecos said never a
word. It was a big roll of bills that he had
brought back from New Mexico—five
months' pay and not a dollar spent. Some
fellows would have the nerve to get married on
that much money. There was a genuine
eighteen-carat, solitaire-diamond engagement-ring
among his plunder, too, but it was no
good to him now. The sheriff examined it
curiously while he was counting the money
and sealing the whole treasure in a strong
envelope.</p>

<p>"I'm <i>dam'</i> sorry I can't give you that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
bridal chamber," he observed, flashing the
diamond and glancing quizzically at the reporter,
and Pecos felt the hot blood leap throbbing
to his brain.</p>

<p>"You go to hell, will you?" he growled, and
a dangerous light came into his eyes as he
rolled them on the laughing crowd.</p>

<p>"Here, here!" chided the deputy, grabbing
him roughly by the arm, and with the gang
following closely upon his heels he led the way
to the cells. A rank smell, like the cagey
reek of a menagerie, smote their nostrils as
they passed through the first barred door and
at sight of another prisoner the men inside the
tanks let out a roar of joy and crowded up to
the bars. It was the flush time of year, when
the district court was in session, and the
authors of six months' crime and disorder were
confined within that narrow space awaiting
the pleasure of the judge. Some there were
with the healthy tan of the sun still upon their
cheeks, and the swarthy sons of Mexico showed
no tendency to prison pallor, but most of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
faces were white and tense, with obscenely
staring eyes and twitching lips, and all of them
were weary unto death. Like wild beasts
that see a victim led to their gate they stormed
and chattered against the bars, shouting
strange words that Pecos could not understand
until, at an order from the deputy, they
scuttled back to their cells.</p>

<p>The Geronimo County jail was a massive
structure of brick, pierced by high windows
set with iron gratings. A narrow corridor led
around the sides, separating the great double-decked
steel tanks from the outer wall, and
within this triumph of the iron-master's craft
the victims of the law's delay swarmed about
like chipmunks in a cage. Down the middle
of the steel enclosure there extended a long
corridor with washrooms at the end and on
either side were rows of cells, with narrow,
inter-connected gates which could be opened
and closed from without. At the word of
command each prisoner slipped deftly through
his door; the deputy unlocked an iron box,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
heaved away upon a lever, and with a resounding
clang all the gratings on one side came to
and were fastened by the interlocking rods.
He opened a box on the opposite side of the
entrance and clanged those doors in place, thus
locking up the last of his dangerous charges
and leaving the corridor empty. Then, producing
another key, he unlocked the great
sliding gate, pulled its heavy panels ajar, and
shoved Pecos roughly through the aperture.
Once more the gates clashed behind him, the
interlocking cell doors flew open, and with a
whoop the uncaged prisoners stepped forth
and viewed their victim.</p>

<p>There is no pretence about a kangaroo
court. By luck and good conduct a citizen of
the outer world may entirely escape the punitive
hand of the law, but every man who entered
the Geronimo County jail was <i>ipso facto</i>
a delinquent. More than that, he was foredoomed
to conviction, for there is no law so
merciless as that of the law's offenders. The
rulings of the kangaroo alcalde are influenced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
by neither pleadings nor precedents, and his
tyranny is mitigated only by the murmurings
of his constituents and the physical limitations
of his strong right hand. Unless by the
heinousness of his former acts he has placed
himself in the aristocracy of crime, he must be
prepared to defend his high position against
all comers; and as the insignia of his office he
carries a strap, with the heavy end of which
he administers summary punishment and puts
down mutinies and revolts. Pete Monat was
the doughty alcalde in the Geronimo Bastile,
and he ruled with an iron hand. For sheriff
he had Michael Slattery, a mere yegg, to do
the dirty work and hale prisoners before the
court. The district attorney was John Doe,
a fierce argufier, who if his nerve had been
equal to his ambition would long since have
usurped the alcalde's place. There were likewise
jail-lawyers galore, petty grafters who
pitted their wits against the prosecuting attorney
in a brave attempt to earn a fee, or at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
least to establish a factitious claim against the
defendant. Out they surged, sheriff, lawyers,
and alcalde, and bore down on Pecos in a body,
the sheriff to arrest him, the lawyers to get his
case, and the alcalde to tip his chair against
the grating, where the reporter could see all
the fun,—and try the case in style.</p>

<p>"Fuzzy!" thundered the yegg sheriff, laying
a heavy hand upon Pecos's shoulder, "I arrest
youse in the name of the law!"</p>

<p>"The hell you say!" exclaimed Pecos, backing
off; and in an instant the hardened jail-birds
knew that they had a "gay-cat." Only
Rubes and gay-cats resisted arrest in jail—the
old-timers stepped up promptly, before
the sheriff could "give them the roust" from
behind.</p>

<p>"Yes, an' fer breakin' into jail!" hollered
Slattery. "Come on now and don't make me
any trouble or I'll cop youse in the mush!"</p>

<p>"Arraign the prisoner," shouted the alcalde
pompously, "bring 'im up hyar, an' ef he's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
half as bad as he looks he'll git the holy limit.
Wake up thar, you, an' he'p the sheriff, or I'll
set you to scrubbin' floors."</p>

<p>They came in a struggling mass, dominated
by the tall form of the sheriff, and before
Pecos was aware of his destiny he was hustled
before the judge.</p>

<p>"What is the charge against this mug?" inquired
Pete Monat, slapping his strap across
his knee for silence.</p>

<p>"Breakin' inter jail, Yer Honor!" responded
the sheriff, bowing and touching his forelock.</p>

<p>"Prisoner at the bar," declaimed the alcalde,
"you are charged with wilfully, feloniously,
an' unlawfully breakin' inter this hyar jail—do
you plead 'Guilty' or 'Not guilty'?"</p>

<p>"I don't plead," said Pecos, with suspicious
quiet.</p>

<p>"'Don't plead' is the same as 'Not guilty,'"
announced the judge, "and bein' as the district
attorney is such a long-winded yap I'll jest
pull off this examination myse'f. How come
you're hyar, then, you low-browed reperbate,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
ef you didn't break inter jail? Answer me
thet, now, an' be dam' careful to say 'Yer
Honor' or I'll soak you for contempt of
court!"</p>

<p>"Say," said Pecos, speaking through the
gratings to Boone Morgan, "do I have to stand
for this? I do? Well, to hell with such a
layout! Here, keep your hands off o' me now,
or somebody'll git badly hurt!" He placed
his back against the grating and menaced the
strong-armed sheriff with a tense fist, turning a
scornful eye upon the clamoring judge.</p>

<p>"<i>Oyez! Oyez!</i> Silence in the court!" bellowed
Pete Monat, leaping up on his chair.
"The prisoner is found guilty and sentenced
to pay a fine of one dollar, or pack out the slops
for a week! Mr. Sheriff, bring 'im up, an' ef
he resists we'll give 'im thirty slaps with this
hyar!" He held up his black strap threateningly,
but Pecos only skinned his teeth like a
wolf that is caught in a trap, and stood at bay.</p>

<p>"I'd like to see the bunch of hobos that can
man-handle <i>me</i>!" he snarled, making a pass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
at the sheriff. "Hey, bring me a dollar!" he
commanded, speaking over his shoulder, and
as the deputy went back to the office to get one
from his envelope the Roman mob fell back
and ceased its clamoring. The dollar was
what they wanted. There was always a Mex
to clean up, but the dollar went for a feed—fruit,
candy, good things to eat—and not
every man who entered could pay his fine. At
the same time they stood off a little from the
prisoner at the bar, for he had a bad look in
his eye. The kangaroo sheriff, standing discreetly
aloof, noticed it; the alcalde also; and
in the premonitory hush that ensued even
Boone Morgan began to read the signs of
trouble. Next to his dream of breaking up
the cattle-stealing business in the mountains,
the Geronimo sheriff cherished the fond hope
of building up a kangaroo court that would
take the entire problem of jail discipline off
his hands. It was an old idea, the kangaroo
court, dimly reminiscent of frontier cow-camps
but smelling more of hoboism, yet good for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
law and order if the right men were in power.
Pete Monat was a terror to the evil-doer,
especially if he was a Mex or darker, and
Boone Morgan stood generously behind him,
even when his decisions were a little rank.
Right now the situation looked ominous and
as Pecos continued to spit forth his venom,
hissing and swelling like a snake at every approach
of the pack, he made bold to interfere
in the puppet play.</p>

<p>"Here," he said, passing a dollar through
the bars, "I'll advance you the money—these
fellows won't hurt you none."</p>

<p>"Keep your dirty dollar!" snapped Pecos,
striking it away, "I got money of my own!"</p>

<p>"Well, you don't need to git mad about it—I
jest wanted to help you."</p>

<p>"Yes, you help me! You throw me into jail
for somethin' I never done and then bring this
bunch of town boys in to see me kangarooed.
That big stiff hain't got no right to fine me a
dollar, an' you know it, but I'll give him the
money all right—you jest wait!" He grinned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
sardonically at Michael Slattery, straightened
his back and waited. He had all the time there
was—the grand jury did not meet till Fall,
and that was six months yet. This was the
law they talked about—this was justice—to
hold a man six months before he came to trial!
Shut him up in that dark, stinking hole and
keep him until he was broken! Sure—and
let a bunch of yeggs spread-eagle him over a
chair and beat him with a strap! For a year
Pecos had been at war with society and never
struck a blow for the revolution. But it was
not too late. In turning him over to a kangaroo
court Boone Morgan had added the last
indignity—it was war now, and war to the
knife.</p>

<p>The deputy returned leisurely, and shoved
a dollar bill through the bars.</p>

<p>"Much obliged," said Pecos, and he spoke
so quietly that even the kangaroo sheriff was
deceived. "Here's your dollar," he said, turning
to hold out the money, "come and git it."
There was a sinister note in that last phrase,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
but Slattery did not catch it. He was a tall,
hulking man, heavy-handed and used to his
own way; the cattle-rustler was short and
broad, like a stocky, hard-rock miner, and he
stood with his back to the bars as if he were
afraid. "Come and git it," he said, very
quietly, but as Mike Slattery reached out his
hand for the money the cowboy grinned and
jerked it back. Slattery grabbed, and like a
flash Pecos put over a blow that was freighted
with sudden death. It landed behind the
yegg sheriff's massive jaw, threw him sideways
and whirled him over; then the thud of
the blow was followed by a thump and like a
boneless carcass he piled up on the floor. To
a man a few removes farther from the ape the
thump on the concrete floor would have resulted
in a cracked skull, but fortunately for
Slattery hard heads and evil dispositions generally
go together, and he was safe from anything
short of an axe. It was the blow under
the ear that had jarred his brains—the bump
against the concrete only finished the job up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
and saved him from something worse. Without
looking to see where his victim fell Pecos
Dalhart leapt vengefully into the swarming
crowd of prisoners, knocking them right and
left like ten-pins and shouting in a hoarse
voice:</p>

<p>"Come an'—<i>huh</i>—git it! Come—<i>huh</i>—and
<i>git</i> it!" And at every grunt he sent home
a blow that laid his man on the floor.</p>

<p>"Back to your cells!" roared Boone Morgan,
rattling the grating like a lion caged away
from a deadly battle. "Git back there and let
me have a chance!" But his voice was
drowned in the deep-voiced challenge of Pecos,
the shrieks of trampled Mexicans, the curses
and sound of blows. Pandemonium broke
loose and in the general uproar all semblance
of order was lost. On the outside of the bars
a pair of shouting deputies menaced the flying
demon of discord with their pistols, calling on
him to stop; Boone Morgan tried to clear the
corridor so that he could open the door; but
they might as well have thundered against the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
wind, for Pecos Dalhart had gone hog wild and
panic lay in his wake.</p>

<p>"Yeee-pah!" he screamed, as the way cleared
up before him. "Hunt your holes, you prairie
dogs, or I'll shore deal you misery! Out of
my road, you dastards—I'm lookin' for that
alcalde!" He fought his way down the corridor,
leaving his mark on every man who opposed
him, and Pete Monat came half way to
meet him. Pete had been a fighter himself
when he first broke into the Geronimo jail
and the confinement had not thinned his sporting
blood. He held the alcalde's strap behind
him, doubled to give it weight, and at the very
moment that Pecos came lunging in he laid
it across his cheek with a resounding whack.
The angry blood stood out along the scar and
before Pecos could dodge back he received another
welt that all but laid him low.</p>

<p>"Hit 'im again! Smash 'im! Fly at 'im,
Pete!" yelled the crowd without, and at the
appearance of a leader the beaten gang of
hobos came out of their holes like bloodhounds.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
Pecos heard the scuffle of feet behind him and
turned to meet them. The fury in his eye
was terrible, but he was panting, and he
staggered as he dodged a blow. For a single
moment he appraised the fighting odds against
him—then with an irresistible rush he battered
his way past the alcalde and grabbed the
back of his chair. In the sudden turmoil and
confusion that humble throne of justice had
been overlooked. It stood against the grating
beyond which Boone Morgan and his
deputies cheered on the kangaroos, and as
Pecos whirled it in the air their shouting
ceased.</p>

<p>There was a crash, a dull thump, and
Pete Monat pitched forward with his throne
hung round his neck. The strap which had
left its cruel mark on Pecos fell to the floor before
him, and Pecos, dropping the broken back
of the chair, stooped and picked it up. The
alcalde lay silent now beside the inert body
of his sheriff and a great hush fell upon the
prison as he stood over them, glaring like a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
lion at bay. He held up a bruised and gory
fist and opened it tauntingly.</p>

<p>"Here's your dollar," he said, waving the
bloody bill above his head, "come and git it,
you sons of goats! You don't want it, hey?
Well, git back into your cells, then—in with
you, or I'll lash you to a frazzle!" They went,
and as the interlocking doors clanged behind
them Pecos turned to Boone Morgan and
laughed. "That's what I think of your Kangaroo
Court," he said, "and your own dam'
rotten laws. Here's to the revolution!"</p>

<p>He flung his blood-red arms above his head
and laughed again, bitterly; and after they
had carried out the injured he paced up and
down the corridor all night, cursing and raving
against the law, while the battered inmates
gazed out through their bars or nodded in
troubled sleep. It was the revolution—no
laws, no order, no government, no nothing!
The base hirelings of the law had thrown him
into jail—all right, he would put their jail on
the bum.</p>

</div>

<p class="ac">THE REVOLUTION IN FACT</p>

<p class="drop-cap">OUTSIDE of the kangarooing of Rubes,
the coming and going of prisoners,
and such exceptional entertainment as that
put up by Pecos Dalhart upon his initiation
into the brotherhood, there were only two
events a day in the Geronimo jail—breakfast
and dinner. Breakfast, as with the
French, was served late, and dinner at the
hour of four. On account of the caterer being
otherwise engaged in the early morning
the <i>café-au-lait</i> in bed was dispensed with and
<i>déjeuner</i> served promptly at nine. It was a
hard-looking aggregation of citizens that crept
out of their cells at the clanging of the interlocking
gates and there was not a man among
them who dared look Pecos in the eye as they
slunk down the corridor to wash. Battered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
in body and cowed in spirit they glanced up
at him deprecatingly as he stood with the strap
in his hand, and there was no mercy written in
the cattle-rustler's scowling visage. These
were the men who would have put their heels
in his face if he had gone down before their
rush—they were cowards and ran in packs,
like wolves. They were grafters, too; the
slinking, servile slaves of jail alcaldes, yegg
sheriffs, and Boone Morgan's swaggering
deputies. More than that, they would mob
him if he gave them half a chance. So he
stood silent, watching them, man after man,
and there was not one who could look him in
the face.</p>

<p>It was Bill Todhunter who opened the gates
that morning—the same keen-eyed, silent
deputy who had fetched Pecos down from the
mountains—and as his former prisoner, now
transformed into the stern master of Geronimo
jail, came near, he looked him over gravely.</p>

<p>"Feelin' any better?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Nope," scowled Pecos, and there the matter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
dropped. After the affair of the night before
he had expected to be put in irons, at
least, or thrown into the dungeon, but nobody
seemed to be worrying about him, and the
prison routine went on as usual. The drunks
in the jag-cell woke up and began to wrangle;
the long-termers in the deck above scuffled
sullenly around over the resounding boiler
plate; and from the outer office they could
hear the cheerful voices of old-timers and politicians
discussing affairs of state. A long-term
trusty came clattering down the iron
stairs and passed out through the two barred
doors to work up an appetite for breakfast by
mowing the court-house lawn. As for Pecos,
he was used to having his breakfast early and
his Trojan exertions of the night before had
left him gaunted, though he carried off his
stoic part bravely. Nevertheless he showed a
more than human interest in the steel front
gate, and when at last, just as the clock tolled
nine, it swung open, admitting the Chinese
<i>restaurateur</i> who contracted for their meals,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
there was a general chorus of approval.
Hung Wo was the name of this caterer to the
incarcerated, and he looked it; but though his
face was not designed for a laughing picture
his shoulders were freighted with two enormous
cans which more than made up for that.
Without a word to any one he lowered the cans
to the floor, jerked off the covers, and began to
dish up on the prison plates. To every man
he gave exactly the same—a big spoonful of
beans, a potato, a hunk of meat, half a loaf of
bread, and a piece of pie—served with the
rapidity of an automaton.</p>

<p>Without waiting for orders the prisoners retreated
noisily into their cells and waited, the
more fastidious shoving sheets of newspaper
through the small openings at the bottom of
their doors to keep their plates off the floor.
But here again there was trouble. The incessant
hammering of pint coffee cups emphasized
the starved impatience of the inmates;
the food grew cold on the plates; only one
thing lay in the way of the belated breakfast—Pecos 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
refused to go into a cell. Before the
fall of the kangaroo court it had been the
privilege and prerogative of Mike Slattery
to remain in the corridor and assist in the distribution
of the food, but Mike was in the
bridal chamber now with his jowls swathed in
cotton, sucking a little nourishment through a
tube. Pete Monat was there also, his head
bandaged to the limit of the physician's art,
and mourning the fate which had left him such
a hard-looking mug on the eve of a jury trial.
The verdict would be guilty, that was a cinch.
But at least Pete was able to eat his breakfast,
whereas there were about forty avid
kangaroos in the tanks who were raising their
combined voices in one agonizing appeal for
food. It was a desperate situation, but Pecos,
as usual, was obdurate.</p>

<p>"Let the Chink come in—I won't hurt
'im!" he said; but Bill Todhunter shook his
head.</p>

<p>"The Chink won't come," he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>"Whassa malla <i>Mike</i>?" inquired Hung
Wo nervously. "He go Yuma?"</p>

<p>"No, Charley," returned Todhunter, "last
night he have one hell of a big fight—this
man break his jaw."</p>

<p>"Whassa malla <i>Pete</i>?"</p>

<p>"This man break his head with chair."</p>

<p>"Ooo!" breathed Hung Wo, peering
through the bars, "me no go in."</p>

<p>"Well, now, you see what you git for your
cussedness," observed the deputy coldly.
"The Chink won't come in and the chances are
you'll starve to death; that is, providin' them
other fellers don't beat you to death first, for
makin' 'em lose their breakfast. Feelin' pretty
cagey, ain't they?"</p>

<p>They were, and Pecos realized that if he
didn't square himself with Hung Wo right
away and get him to feed the animals, he
would have a bread riot on his hands later—and
besides, he was hungry himself. So he
spoke quickly and to the point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's the matter, Charley?" he expostulated,
"you 'fraid of me?"</p>

<p>"Me no likee!" said the Chinaman impersonally.</p>

<p>"No, of course not; but here—lemme tell
you! You savvy Pete Monat—all same
alcalde, eh? You savvy Mike—all same boss,
hey? Well, last night me lick Pete and Mike.
You see this strap? All right; <i>me</i> boss now—you
give me big pie every day, you come in!"</p>

<p>"Me no got big pie to-day," protested Hung
Wo anxiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right—me takum other feller's
pie, this time—you come in!"</p>

<p>"Allite!" agreed the simple-minded Oriental,
and when the iron doors rolled apart he
entered without a quiver. Back where he
came from a bargain is a bargain and it is a
poor boss indeed who does not demand his rake-off.
The day was won and, throwing back
his head imperiously, Pecos stalked down the
line of cells until he came to the one where the
inmates were making the most noise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here!" he said, and when they looked up
he remarked: "You fellers are too gay to suit
me—I'll jest dock you your pieces of pie!"
And when the Chinaman arrived Pecos carefully
lifted the pie from each plate and piled
all up on his own. "This'll teach you to keep
your mouths shut!" he observed, and retiring
to the iron gates he squatted down on his heels
and ate greedily.</p>

<p>"Well, the son-of-a-gun," murmured Bill Todhunter,
as he took notice of this final triumph,
and the men in the cells became as quiet as a
cage of whip-broke beasts when the lion tamer
stands in their midst. As Pecos Dalhart
drank his second cup of coffee and finished up
the last slab of pie a realizing sense of his
mastery came over him and he smiled grimly
at the watchful faces that peered out through
the cell gratings, blinking and mowing like
monkeys in a zoo. They were beaten, that was
plain, but somehow as he looked them over he
was conscious of a primordial cunning written
on every savage visage—they bowed before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
him; but like the leopards before their tamer,
they crouched, too. That was it—they
crouched and bided their time, and when the
time came they would hurl themselves at his
throat. But what was it for which they were
waiting? All the morning he pondered on it
as he paced to and fro or sat with his back
to the bars, watching. Then, as the day
warmed up and his head sank momentarily
against his breast he woke with a start to behold
a prison-bleached hand reaching, reaching
for his strap. Instantly he rose up from
his place and dealt out a just retribution, laying
on his strap with the accuracy of a horse-wrangler,
but even with the howling of his
victim in his ears he was afraid, for he read the
hidden meaning of that act. With the nerveless
patience of the beast they were waiting
for him to go to sleep!</p>

<p>Once before, on the open range, Pecos Dalhart
had arrayed himself against society, and
lost, even as he was losing now. Sooner or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
later, by day or by night, these skulking
hyenas of the jail-pack would catch him asleep,
and he shuddered to think how they might
mangle him. He saw it clearly now, the fate
of the man who stands alone, without a friend
to watch over him or a government to protect
his life. Not in two hurly-burly days and
nights had he closed his bloodshot eyes, and as
the heaviness of sleep crept upon him he paced
up and down the corridor, wrestling with the
spectre that was stealing away his wits and
hoping against hope that Boone Morgan would
come to his aid, for Boone had seen his finish
from the first. In sodden abandonment to his
destiny he looked one of the cells over to see
if it could be barricaded, but when one door
was open they were all open and there was
no protection against stealth or assault. He
had not even the protection of the cave-dweller
who, when sleep overcame him, could retire
and roll a great stone against his door. Yet
as the possession of sleep took hold upon him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
he routed out the inmates of the cell nearest to
the gate, climbed into the upper bunk and lay
there, rigid, fighting to keep awake.</p>

<p>It was quiet now and the shuffling of the
long-termers above him came fainter and
fainter; some drunk out in the jag-cell woke
up from his long slumber and began to sing
mournfully; and Pecos, struggling against the
deadly anæsthetic of his weariness, listened intently
to every word.</p>

<p>A hush fell upon the jail as the singer wailed
forth his sad lament, and when the song was
ended a murmur ran along the hall. Pecos
listened, half in a doze, to the muttered comments;
then with a jerk he sat up and stared.
The man in the next cell had said,</p>

<p>"That's old Babe, singin' his jag-song.
He'll be in here pretty soon."</p>

<p>Babe! And he would be in there pretty
soon! At that magic word a new life swept
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
through Pecos Dalhart's veins; his drowsiness
left him, and rousing up from his bunk he
struggled forth and washed his face at the tap.
Time and again he slapped the cool water upon
his neck and hair; he drank a last draught of
its freshness and paced the length of the corridor,
his head bowed as if in thought—but listening
above all other noises for the sound of
Angy's voice. Bill Todhunter came and
glanced at him impersonally, as he might gaze
at a bronc that was about to be broke, but
Pecos made no appeal. He had started out
to wreck Boone Morgan's jail for him, break
up his Kangaroo Court, and establish the revolution,
and with Angy's help he would do it,
yet. The jail gang edged in on him a little
closer, dogging his steps as the wolf-pack follows
its kill, but at every turn of his shaggy
head they slunk away. Then at last, just as
the clock tolled four, the keys clanked in the
outer door; Hung Wo slipped in with his
coffee-pot and can, and after him came Angevine
Thorne, escorted by the deputy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hello, Babe!" chimed a chorus from behind
the bars. "Hey, Babe—sing 'Kansas'! Oh,
Babe!" But Angevine Thorne had no thought
for his quondam prison mates, he was placing
himself on record in a protest against the law.</p>

<p>"The Constitution of the United States guarantees
to every man a fair and speedy trial," he
declaimed with drunken vehemence, "but look
here and see what a mockery you have made
the law! Look at these poor men, caged up
here yet, waiting for their trial! Is that a fair
and speedy hearing? Look at me; arrested
for no offence; confined without cause; condemned
without a hearing; imprisoned for no
crime! Is that justice? Justice forsooth! It
is conspiracy—treachery—crime! Yes, I
say <i>crime</i>! You are the criminals and we the
helpless victims of your hands! I appeal to
God, if there is a God, to bear witness of my innocence!
What? I must go in? Then throw
open your prison doors—I die a martyr to the
Cause!"</p>

<p>The clanging of the cell doors gave no pause
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
to his impassioned eloquence, nor yet his sudden
injection into jail; but when, as he swayed
upon his heels, his eyes fell upon the haggard
features of Pecos Dalhart, the apostle of civic
equality stopped short and struck his brow
with a despairing hand.</p>

<p>"What!" he cried. "Are you here, Cumrad?
Then let me die forthwith, for tyranny has done
its worst! Pecos Dalhart, immured within
prison walls, torn from the fond embrace of
his—but hush, I go too far. Pecos, old boy,
in the years to come your name shall go down
to posterity as a martyr to the Cause. You
have been arrested, sir, for no crime in law or
fact, but simply for your outspoken opposition
to the foul conspiracy of capitalism. Oh, that
I might stand before the people and plead your
cause—But enough; how are you, Old
Hoss?"</p>

<p>He gathered Pecos into his arms and embraced
him, and to the astonishment of Hung
Wo and the prisoners Pecos hugged him to
his breast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm dam' glad to see you, Angy," he murmured,
"and no mistake. Here—take this
strap and keep them fellers off—I'm dyin'
for a sleep." He reached back for the floor,
slipped gently down and stretched out upon
the hard concrete. When Angevine Thorne
lifted up his head he was asleep.</p>

<p>"Poor old Pecos," said Angy, holding out
his hands as Mark Antony did over Cæsar,
"there he lies, a victim to his country's laws.
But sleep, old friend, and the first man that
disturbs your dreams will feel the weight of
this!" He held up the alcalde's strap for emphasis,
and a low rumble of disapproval went
up from the rows of cells.</p>

<p>"He broke every head in jail last night," volunteered
the deputy, "an' it's about time he
was kangarooed!"</p>

<p>"Not while I live!" declared Angy tragically.
"Right or wrong, the first man that lays
hands on this poor corse will fight it out with
me!"</p>

<p>A chorus of defiance and derision was his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
only answer, but Angevine Thorne, being a
natural-born orator, knew better than to reiterate
his remarks for emphasis. He balanced
the big strap in his hand as a warrior
might test his sword, and squatted down to eat.
While the dinner hour lasted he was safe—after
that he would feel his way. So he put
his back to the bars and began to take a little
nourishment, gnashing belligerently at his
hunk of meat and fortifying himself with
coffee—but that was not to be the limit of his
fare. As he scuttled back and forth with the
prison plates, Hung Wo had kept an attentive
eye upon the prostrate form of his boss and,
seeing no signs of returning animation, had
looked worried. At last, as Angy's protectorate
became evident, he returned to his copper
can and produced a fine big pie.</p>

<p>"This for boss," he said, and placed it by
Pecos's head.</p>

<p>"All right, Wo," responded Angy, "my
friend, he sleep. Bimeby wakum up, I give
him pie." He finished up his plate, glanced at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
the surly faces behind the bars, and cast a longing
look at the fresh-baked pie. There was
going to be a ruction, that was sure, and ructions
are bad for pies. He took Pecos by the
shoulder and shook him tentatively; then with
a sigh of Christian resignation he reached over
and picked up the pie. "Dam' shame to go
and waste it," he muttered, "an' it's all right,
too."</p>

<p>The prisoners watched him eat his way
through the crust and down through the middle
until finally he licked his finger-tips and
smiled.</p>

<p>"Him good pie, Wo," he observed, rising to
his feet, "make me hip stlong." He shoved
Pecos back into the corner, took his place before
him, and balanced the strap for battle.
"All right, deputy," he said, "turn them tarriers
loose, and if I don't tan their hides with this
strap they ain't no hell no mo'!"</p>

<p>The cell doors clanged and flew open, the
balked cohorts of the enemy stepped forth and
gathered about him, and as Angy paced back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
and forth before his friend he opened wide the
flood-gates of his wrath.</p>

<p>"See the skulkin' curs and cowards," he
cried, lashing out at them with his strap, "see
them cringe before the whip like the servile
slaves they are. What has this man done that
you should fall upon him? Broke up your
court, hey? Well, what was the court to you?
Didn't it punish you whether you were right
or wrong? Didn't it tyrannize over you and
force you to do its will? Ah, despicable dogs,
that would lick the hand that strikes you—come
out here, any one of you, and I swear I'll
beat you to death. Hah! You are afraid!
You are afraid to face an honest man and
fight him hand to hand! Or is it something
else?" The defiant tone left his voice of a sudden
and he looked eagerly into their tense
faces. "Or is it something else?" he cried.
"Friends, you have been shut up here for
months by that great crime they call the law.
You know that law—how it protects the rich
and crushes down the poor! What then—do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
you still worship its outworn forms so that you
must suffer them even in jail? Must you still
have a sheriff to harass you, a judge to condemn
you, a district attorney to talk you blind?
Must you still be tyrannized over by a false
and illegal court, even in the shadow of the
jail? God forbid! But what then? Ah, yes;
what then! Friends, I bring you the Gospel
of Equality; I stand before you to proclaim as
our forebears proclaimed before us, that all
men are born free and equal; I call upon you,
even in this prison, to cast aside the superstition
of government and proclaim the revolution!
To hell with the Kangaroo Court! My friend
here has beaten up its officers—let us abolish
it forever! What? Is it a go? Then here's
to the revolution!"</p>

<p>He waved his hand above his head, smiling
upward at that fair Goddess of Liberty whom
he discerned among the rods; and the gaping
prisoners, carried away by his eloquence, let out
a mighty yell of joy. Worn and jaded by the
dull monotony of their life they seized upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
the new religion with undiscriminating zest,
passing up the big words and the moonshine
and rejoicing in their noble freedom from
restraint. As the first symptoms of a jail-riot
began to develop Boone Morgan and his deputies
rushed out to quell the disturbance, but
the revolution gave no promise of a rough-house.
As was to be expected, the prostrate
form of Pecos Dalhart was draped across the
foreground—and served him right, for trying
to get too gay—but the other figures were not
in good support. Angevine Thorne stood
above the body of his friend, waving the alcalde's
strap, but the Roman mob was sadly
out of part. It was dancing around the room
singing "Kansas."</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
      <div class="verse">"I'll tell you what they do—<i>in Kansas</i>,"</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>they howled.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
      <div class="verse">"I'll tell you what they do—<i>in Kansas</i>,"</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>and at the end of each refrain Angy lifted up
his vibrant tenor and added yet another chapter
to the shameless tale. It was a bacchanalia
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
of song, perhaps; or a saturnalia of inter-State
revilings; but none of the onlookers recognized
in the progressive dirtiness of the words a spirit
of protest against the law. The revolution
had come, but like many another promising
child it was too young to be clearly differentiated
from its twin brothers, License and
Liberty.</p>

<div class="chapter">
   <h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
</div>

<p class="ac">BACK TO NATURE</p>

<p class="drop-cap">AS to what the revolution is or is to be
there are no two authorities who agree.
It is not a thing, to be measured and defined;
nay, it is a dream which, like our ideas of
heaven, varies with individuals. To the philosopher
it is an earthly realization of all our
heavenly aspirations; to the low-browed man-of-hands
something less, since his aspirations
are less, but still good to cure all social ills.
When Pecos Dalhart entered the Geronimo
County jail he turned it into his own idea of the
revolution—a fighting man's paradise, like
the Valhalla of the ancients, where the heroes
fought all day and were made good as new
over night; but when he woke up from his
long sleep, behold, Angy had established a
philosophical revolution in its stead! At first
he was so glad to wake up at all that he did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
inspect the new social structure too closely—it
had saved him from a terrible beating, that
was sure—but as the day wore on and a gang
of yeggs began to ramp about he shook his
head and frowned.</p>

<p>"Say, Angy," he said, "what did you tell
them fellers last night to make 'em take on like
this?"</p>

<p>"Told 'em the same old story, Cumrad—how
the monopolistic classes has combined
with the hell hounds of the law to grind us pore
men down. Ain't it glorious how the glad
news has touched their hearts? Even within
the walls of our prison they are happy!"</p>

<p>"Umph!" grunted Pecos, and scowled up at
a tall Mexican who had ventured to call him
<i>compadre</i>. "What's all this <i>compañero</i>
talk that's goin' on amongst the Mexicans—are
they in on the deal, too?"</p>

<p>"Surest thing!" responded Angy warmly.</p>

<p>"Huh!" said Pecos, "I hope they don't try
no <i>buen' amigo</i> racket on me—I was raised to
regard Mexicans like horny toads."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>"All men is brothers—that's my motto.
And they's good Mexicans, too, remember
that. Just think of Joe Garcia!"</p>

<p>"Yes!" rejoined Pecos, with heat, "<i>think</i> of
'im! If it wasn't for that saddle-colored dastard
I'd be free, 'stead of rottin' in this hole.
I says to the judge: 'I bought that cow and
calf off of Joe Garcia—there he is, standin'
over there—I summon him for a witness.'
'Is that your calf?' says the judge. 'Kin
savvy,' he says, humpin' up his back. 'Did
you sell him to this man?' '<i>Yo no se!</i>' says
Joe, and he kept it up with his 'No savvys' and
his 'I don't knows' until the dam' judge
throwed me into jail. Sure! I'm stuck on
Mexicans! I'll brother 'em, all right, if they
come around me—I'll brother 'em over the
head with a club!"</p>

<p>"Jest the same, it was Mexicans that saved
your bacon last night," retorted Angy, with
spirit. "Some of these white men that you
had beat up were for pushin' your face in
while you was asleep, but when I made a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
talk in Spanish, touchin' on your friendly relations
with the Garcia family, the Mexicans
came over in a body and took your part. That
was pretty good, hey?"</p>

<p>"Um," responded Pecos, but he assented
without enthusiasm. Barring the one exception
which went to prove the rule, he had never
had much use for Mexicans—and Marcelina
was a happy accident, not to be looked for
elsewhere in the Spanish-American world.
Still, a man had to have <i>some</i> friends; and a
Mex was better than a yegg, anyhow. He
looked around until he found the tall man who
had called him <i>compadre</i> and beckoned him
with an imperious jerk of the head. The
Mexican came over doubtfully.</p>

<p>"You speak English?" inquired Pecos.
"That's good—I want to tell you something.
My friend here says you and your <i>compadres</i>
stood up for me last night when I was down
and out—hey? Well, that's all right—I'm
a Texano and I ain't got much use for Mexicanos
in general, but any time you boys git
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
into trouble with them yeggs, jest call on me!
Savvy?"</p>

<p>The tall man savvied and though Pecos still
regarded them with disfavor the Mexican contingency
persisted in doing him homage—only
now they referred to him as <i>El Patrón</i>.
<i>Patrón</i> he was, and Boss, though he never
raised a hand. Interpreting aright his censorious
glances the sons of Mexico confined their
celebration of the Dawn of Freedom to a carnival
of neglect, lying in their bunks and smoking
<i>cigarritos</i> while the filth accumulated in the
slop cans. Under the iron rule of Pete Monat
they had been required to do all the cleaning
up—for in Arizona a Mexican gets the dirty
end of everything—but no sooner had Babe
sung his clarion call for freedom than they
joined him, heart and hand. If the Society
of the Revolution was at all related to the
Sons of Rest they wanted to go down as charter
members—and they did.</p>

<p>The time may come when cleanliness will be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
an inherited instinct but at present most of
the cleaning up in the world is done under
compulsion. Parents compel their children to
wash and change their clothes; employers compel
their wage-slaves to scrub and clean and
empty; cities compel their householders to dispose
of sewage and garbage; but not even
among members of the capitalistic classes is
there shown any clean-cut desire to do the work
themselves. The Arizona Indians escape
their obligations by moving camp at intervals,
and God's sunshine helps out the settlers; but
in the Geronimo jail there was no sunshine,
nor could any Indian break camp. They
were shut in, and there they had to lie, three
deep, until the judge should decide their fate.
For two days they had luxuriated in anarchy,
philosophical and real, but neither kind emptied
any garbage. The jail was the dwelling
place of Freedom, but it smelled bad. That
was a fact. Even the Mexicans noticed it,
but they did not take it to heart. It was only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
when Boone Morgan came down for a batch
of prisoners that the community got its orders
to clean up.</p>

<p>These were busy days with Boone—opening
court, arraigning prisoners, summoning
witnesses, roping in jurymen, speaking a good
word for some poor devil in the tanks—and
it kept him on the run from sun-up to dark.
He knew that Pecos Dalhart had broken up
his Kangaroo Court and that Angevine Thorne
had pulled off some kind of a tin-horn revolution
on him, but he didn't mind a little thing
like that. Jail life had its ups and downs,
but so long as the cage was tight the birds
could do as they pleased—short of raising
a riot. At least, that was Boone Morgan's
theory, based on the general proposition that
he could stand it as long as they could—but
when at the end of the second day he caught a
whiff of the sublimated jail-smell that rose
from the abiding place of liberty he let out a
"whoosh" like a bear.</p>

<p>"Holy Moses, Bill," he cried, "make these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
rascals clean up! M-mmm! That would drive
a dog out of a tan-yard! What's the matter—is
somebody dead?"</p>

<p>"Not yet," responded Bill Todhunter, "but
they will be, if we don't git some trusty in
there. Them fellers won't do <i>nuthin'</i>—an'
I can't go in there and make 'em! You better
appoint another alcalde."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with Pete?"</p>

<p>"His head is too sore—he won't be able to
put up a fight for a month."</p>

<p>"Umm, and Mike is fixed worse yet—where's
that crazy cowman, Pecos Dalhart?"</p>

<p>They found Pecos comfortably bestowed in
the bunk of the end cell, philosophically smoking
jail tobacco as a deodorizer.</p>

<p>"Say," said the sheriff, brusquely addressing
him through the bars, "things are gittin'
pretty rotten around here—somebody ought
to make them Mexicans clean up. You put
my Kangaroo Court out of business—how'd
you like the job yourself?"</p>

<p>Pecos grunted contemptuously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't want it, hey? Well, you don't have
to have it—I can get that big sheep-man
down from the upper tanks."</p>

<p>A cold glint came into Pecos Dalhart's eyes,
but he made no remarks—a big sheep-man
would just about fall in with his mood.</p>

<p>"I got to have some kind of a trusty," observed
Morgan, but as Pecos did not rise to
the bait, he passed down the run-around grumbling.</p>

<p>"He's a sulky brute," said Bill Todhunter,
as they retreated from the stench, "better leave
him alone a while and see if we can't stink him
out."</p>

<p>"Well, you order them Mexicans to clean
up," rumbled the sheriff, "and if this here Pecos
Dalhart makes any more trouble I'll see
that he gits roped and hog-tied. And say,
throw old Babe out of there as soon as he gits
his supper. Them two fellers are side-kickers
in this business and we got to bust 'em up.
It's a good thing the grand jury ain't in session
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
now—I'd git hell for the condition of
that jail."</p>

<p>There never was a jail so clean it didn't
smell bad, but that night the Geronimo jail
broke into the same class with the Black Hole
of Calcutta, yet the inmates seemed to enjoy it.
The yegg gang in particular—a choice assortment
of Chi Kids, Denver Slims, and Philly
Blacks who had fled from the Eastern winter—were
having the time of their lives, rampaging
up and down the corridor, upsetting cuspidors,
throwing water from the wash-room, and making
themselves strictly at home. When the
sturdy form of Pecos Dalhart appeared in the
door of Cell One they slackened their pace a
little, but now that the moral restraint of Babe
was gone they felt free as the prairie wind.
Only in their avoidance of Mexicans did they
show a certain consciousness of authority, for
the word had passed that Pecos was <i>buen'
amigo</i> with the <i>umbres</i> and no one was looking
for a rough-house. As for Pecos, he put in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
time thinking, standing aloof from friends and
enemies alike—and his thoughts were of the
revolution. When he had been off by himself
reading the <i>Voice of Reason</i> he had been astounded
at the blank stupidity of the common
people, which alone was holding mankind
back from its obvious destiny. "Think, Slave,
think!" it used to say; and thinking was so
easy for him. But the blind and brutish wage
slaves who were dragged at the chariot wheels
of capitalism—well, perhaps they had not yet
learned how. Anyway, he had seen how inevitable
was the revolution, and whichever
way he turned he saw new evidences of that
base conspiracy between wealth and government
which keeps the poor man down. Nay,
he had not only seen it—he had suffered at its
hand. Yet there was one thing which he had
never realized before, though the <i>Voice of
Reason</i> was full of it—the low and churlish
spirit of the masses which incapacitated them
for freedom. Take those yeggs, now. They
had been freed from the hard and oppressive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
hand of tyranny and yet as soon as the Kangaroo
Court was abolished they began to raise
particular hell. It was discouraging. There
was only one way to beat sense into some people,
and that was with a club. A cuspidor
came the length of the corridor and Pecos rose
slowly from his couch. What was the use of
trying the revolution on a gang of narrow-headed
yeggs!</p>

<p>"Hey," he challenged, "you yaps want to
key down a little or I'll rattle your heads together.
Go on into your cells now, and shut
up." He fixed the yegg-men sternly with his
eye, but the blood had gone to their heads
from gambolling about and they still had their
dreams of heaven.</p>

<p>"Aw, gwan," said Philly Black, "we ain't
doin' nawthin'—give a feller a show, can't
ye?"</p>

<p>"W'y, sure, I'll give you a show!" thundered
Pecos wrathfully. "You yeggs think because
I licked Pete Monat I give you license to prize
up hell. You got this jail like a hog-waller
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
already in two days. Now, clean up, you dastards,
and the first man that opens his face to
me will go to the doctor!"</p>

<p>There was no easy answer to an argument
like that and the gang slouched sullenly to
their task, making all the motions of a superficial
cleaning up but leaving the jail dirtier
than ever. With his strap poised Pecos stood
over them, reading well the insubordination in
their black hearts and waiting only for some
one to start the fray. At every move the
yeggs became viler and more slipshod in their
methods, spilling half the contents of every can
upon the floor, and still Pecos Dalhart eyed
them grimly, while the awe-stricken Mexicans
huddled together in their cells waiting for the
catastrophe. At last Philly Black, emboldened
by his immunity, was moved to take a
chance. Seizing recklessly upon the nearest
can he made a rush for the wash-room, slopping
filth and corruption as he went. As he passed
Pecos his hold slipped, accidentally, of course,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
and the can fell to the floor with a final overflowing of uncleanness.</p>

<p>"Clean that up," Pecos said, as Philly Black
came to a crouch, but Philly only looked over
his shoulder. "Clean that up!" commanded
Pecos, drawing nearer. "<i>Clean</i>—" but Philly
was cleaning up. His gang had not rallied to
his aid. Slowly and slovenly, and making
ugly faces, he bent to his unwilling task,
scowling beneath his black mop of hair at Denver
and Chi and the gang.</p>

<p>"I said <i>clean up</i>!" rumbled Pecos, as Philly
grabbed his can to go. "<i>Clean up!</i> You don't
call that clean, do you?"</p>

<p>"Aw, go t'hell!" bellowed Philly Black,
hurling his slop-can once more upon the floor.
"Let the dam' Mexicans clean up!"</p>

<p>He dodged the swift swing of the strap and
leapt in, calling on his fellows for aid. For a
moment they wrestled furiously, and as the
yeggs rushed in to help, the Mexicans swarmed
out to meet them; but before either side could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
lend a hand Philly Black slipped on his own
dirty floor and went down with a deadly thud.
Pecos rode him to the floor, clutching fiercely
at his throat; for an instant he waited for him
to fight back, then he sprang up and waded
into the yeggs. Philly was where he would
make no trouble for quite a while.</p>

<p>Once more at the clamor of battle the jail
deputies came rushing to the rescue, bending
their futile pistols upon the yelling prisoners.</p>

<p>"It's that blankety-blank, Pecos Dalhart!"
shouted Bill Todhunter as he goggled through
the bars. "Well, the son of a goat, ain't he a
fightin' fool!" There was a note almost of admiration
in his voice, for Pecos was punching
heads and belting yeggs with the calculating
rage of a conqueror.</p>

<p>"Git out of my way, <i>umbres</i>!" he yelled to
his Mexican retainers. "<i>Vaya se</i>—<i>vamos</i>—I
can fix 'em!" And he surely did. In his
strong hands the alcalde's strap was a deadly
weapon; he swung it with a puncher's skill and
laid it on like a horse-wrangler. Shrieks for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
mercy were mingled with howls of pain and
every time a man stood up to him he slugged
him with all his strength. The floor was
strewn with yeggs and when he had beaten
down all opposition he flogged them into their
cells.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord"><a name="i_257.jpg" id="i_257.jpg"></a>
  <img src="images/i_257.jpg"
        alt="" />
  <div class="caption">"You <i>will</i> turn this jail into a hog-waller, will you?"
    he demanded</div>
</div>

<p>"You <i>will</i> turn this jail into a hog-waller,
will you?" he demanded, when the corridor was
cleared of men. "You <i>will</i> throw slops on the
floor and not half clean 'em up! Well, come
outer there, you low-browed hobos—<i>I'll</i> show
you how it's done! Now take them swabs and
fill your cans with water and wash this floor up
right. No, you stay where you are, <i>umbres</i>;
I want to show these brake-beam tourists
who's the boss. <i>Jump</i> now, you panhandlers,
or I'll burn you up with this!" He swung
his wet strap and popped it behind the Chi
Kid, and Chi went on his way. Bill Todhunter
and the jail deputy looked curiously on
through the bars; the reporter for the morning
<i>Blade</i> showed up suddenly from nowhere
and began to ask leading questions, but Pecos
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
did not unbend. In vain the reporter tried to
beckon him up to the bars—Pecos remembered
him too well as the fresh young man who
had made a jest of his breaking into jail; also
he hoped he could do a little job of house-cleaning
without going on record as the friend
of old Boone Morgan. He might be a little
weak on the revolution but he knew his natural
enemies. These were the men who had thrown
him into jail for branding his own cow's calf;
they were the hirelings of the System, friends
to the rich and enemies to the poor; to them
the agony of his soul was no more than a passing
jest. He turned on the reporter and
scowled.</p>

<p>"Go take a run and jump at yourself!" he
said.</p>

<p class="ac">THE POWER OF THE PRESS</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE power of a venal and subsidized
press in moulding public opinion is a
thing that can hardly be overstated, even by
the <i>Voice of Reason</i>. When Pecos Dalhart
told the willowy young man from the <i>Blade</i>
to take a running jump at himself he expressed
as in no other way his absolute contempt
for society. Young Mr. Baker of the
Geronimo <i>Blade</i> had the cigarette habit, he
drank whiskey, and his private life would not
bear too close inspection—he was hardly the
man that one would choose as a censor of public
character—and yet he held the job.
When Pecos had broken up Boone Morgan's
Kangaroo Court and spoiled the clever little
court-house skit that Mr. Baker had framed
up in his mind, that unprincipled young man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
had alluded to him, briefly and contemptuously,
as a bad <i>hombre</i> from the Verde country, a
desperate fellow, etc., and had ended by saying
that Sheriff Morgan, who was convinced that
he had a dangerous criminal on his hands, was
looking up his record in Texas. That was a
lovely introduction for a man who was held for
the grand jury—it reached the eye of nearly
every qualified juror in the county and was
equivalent to about seven years in Yuma. If
Mr. Baker had been human this last admonition
about the running jump would have raised
it to fourteen years, but they were short of
copy that day and Baker was only a reporter,
so he sharpened up his pencil and wrote a little
jolly, just to keep Boone Morgan in good
humor.</p>

<div class="bq">

<p class="ac">JAIL STRIKE A FAILURE</p>

<p>"Mr. Pecos Q. Dalhart, who signalized his incarceration
in the county jail by breaking up the prisoners'
court, sending the Hon. Pete Monat and Michael Slattery
to the hospital, and beating up the defenceless inmates
with a chair, pulled off another little <i>soirée</i> last night,
though for a different cause. It appears that when
Mr. Dalhart registered at the Hotel de Morgan he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
been reading a certain incendiary sheet which panders
to the unreasoning prejudice of the ignorant by a general
rave against the established order of things. With
his mind inflamed by this organ of anarchy Mr. Dalhart
conceived the original and ambitious idea of destroying
the last vestige of law, order, and government within
the walls of his prison, and Sheriff Morgan, being of a
tolerant disposition, decided to let him try it on and see
how he enjoyed the results. Not every public officer
would have had the courage to permit such a firebrand
to carry on his propaganda unhindered, but Boone Morgan
has merited the confidence of every citizen of
Geronimo County by his fearless handling of the desperate
men entrusted to his care, and the outcome of this
episode is a case in point. Only three days were needed
to convince the bad man from Verde Crossing of the
error of his way. His first outbreak was to destroy all
law and order—his second was to enforce the sanitary
regulations of the prison. By his sudden and decided
stand for cleanliness Mr. Dalhart has shown that he
possesses the capacity for better things, even if he did
make a slight mistake in regard to Isaac Crittenden's
spotted calf. The scrap was a jim-dandy, while it
lasted, but the issue was never in doubt, for the Verde
terror is a whirlwind when he gets started. There have
been house-cleanings galore in the past, but never within
the memory of man has the Geronimo jail received such
a washing and scrubbing as was administered when Dalhart
rose up in his wrath and put down the very strike
which he had organized; and while the sheriff cannot
but deprecate his tendency to resort to violence there is
no gainsaying the fact that in this case his motives were
of the best. Stay with it, Pecos, you may be alcalde
yet!"</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>Pecos Dalhart was sitting in lonely state,
eating the fresh-baked pie which Hung Wo
conferred upon him as the Boss, when Bill
Todhunter shoved a copy of the Geronimo
<i>Blade</i> through the bars.</p>

<p>"See you got yore name in the paper," he
observed, but Pecos only grunted. Curiosity
is an attribute of the child—and besides, he
was more interested in his pie. It had always
been an ambition of his to have pie three times
a day, and the steady round of beef, bread, and
coffee incidental to life on the range had made
that hope seem a dream dear enough almost to
justify matrimony. At least, he had never expected
to attain to it any other way; but Hung
Wo was a good cook, when he wanted to be.
To serve two prison meals a day for fourteen
cents and a profit meant pretty close figuring,
and the patrons of Hung Wo's downtown restaurant
needed to have no compunctions about
leaving a part of their bounteous dinner untouched—the
guests of the Hotel de Morgan
were not supposed to be superstitious about eating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
"come-backs." It would be a poor Chinaman
who could not feed you on ten cents a day,
if you didn't care what you ate. But Pecos
cared, and he cast a glance that was almost
benevolent upon his faithful pie-maker as he
tucked the <i>Blade</i> into his shirt.</p>

<p>"That's good pie, Charley," he said approvingly.
"Some day when you ketchum big
hurry I make him boy wash dishes."</p>

<p>"Allite," responded Hung Wo, "you likee
kek?"</p>

<p>"Sure thing! You savvey makum cake?"</p>

<p>"Me makum kek, pie, cha'lotte lusse, custa'd,
plenty mo'!" declaimed Charley, with
pride.</p>

<p>"Sure! I know you! You keep big restaurant—down
by Turf Saloon, hey? I eat
there, one time—heap good!"</p>

<p>"You tlink so?" beamed the child-like Oriental.
"Allite, next time me bingum kek!"
He gathered up the tin pannikins and departed,
radiant, while Pecos crouched peacefully
on his heels against the corridor bars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p>"Say, they's a piece about you in that paper,"
volunteered Todhunter, as he jerked
open the cell doors, "that young feller that was
here last night wrote it up."</p>

<p>"Aw, to hell with 'im," growled Pecos
scornfully; but at the same time he was interested.
Life within prison walls is not very
exciting—there is lots of company, but not of
the best, and any man who does not want to
hear dirty stories or learn how "mooching" and
"scoffing" is done, or the details of the jungle
life, is likely in time to become lonely. Already
he was hungry for the outdoor life—the beating
of the hot sun, the tug of the wind, the feel
of the saddle between his knees—but alas, he
was doomed to spend his unprofitable days in
jail, a burden to himself and society! Six
months in jail, before he could come before
the grand jury and have his trial—six
months, and it had not yet been six days. He
drew the morning <i>Blade</i> from his bosom and
examined it carefully, searching vainly through
editorial columns and patent insides until
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
at last he caught the heading: "Jail Strike a
Failure. Bad Man from Verde Crossing
Makes Prisoners Clean Up." Then he read
the article through carefully, mumbling over
the big words in the hope of sensing their meaning
and lingering long over his name in print.
At the allusion to the <i>Voice of Reason</i> he
flushed hot with indignation; muttered curses
greeted the name of Sheriff Morgan; but every
time he came to "Mr. Dalhart" he smiled
weakly and nursed his young mustache. But
after he had finished he went back and gazed
long and intently at his full name as given at
the beginning:—"Mr. Pecos Q. Dalhart"—Pecos
Q.! He read the entire paper over carefully
and came back to it again; and that evening,
when Mr. Baker of the <i>Blade</i> strolled in,
he beckoned him sternly to the bars.</p>

<p>"Say," he said, "what the hell you mean by
puttin' that 'Q.' in my name—Pecos Q. Dalhart?
My name is Pecos straight—named
after that river in Texas!"</p>

<p>"Oh, is it?" cried the young reporter, making
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
a hurried note. "Well, I beg your pardon,
Mr. Dalhart, I'm sure. How's house-cleaning
to-day? Organized your court yet? No?
Well, when you do, let me know. Always like
to be present, you understand, when you have
a trial." He hurried away, as if upon important
business, and slowed down as suddenly
before the sheriff's office.</p>

<p>"That 'Q.' did the business," he observed,
glancing triumphantly at the assembled company.
"I told you I'd make that rustler talk.
A man may not give a dam' what you say
about him but he goes crazy if you get his name
wrong—I found that out long ago. Mr.
Dalhart informs me that his name is Pecos
straight—no 'Q.' in it. Pecos Straight Dalhart!
All right, I'll try to get it right next
time. What'll you bet we don't have another
Kangaroo Court before the end of the week?"</p>

<p>"The cigars," replied Boone Morgan casually.
As a politician, cigars were a matter of
small import to him—when he was not giving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
them away his friends were giving cigars to
him.</p>

<p>"I'll go you!" cried Baker enthusiastically,
"and the drinks, too. You better turn Mr.
Dalhart over to me for a while and watch me
make a man out of him. All I ask is that you
give him the morning <i>Blade</i>."</p>

<p>"All right," assented Bill Todhunter, from
the corner; and the next morning Pecos received
it with his breakfast. Charley Hung
Wo had provided him with an unusually
tempting apple roll that morning but it was
neglected for the moment while he ran over
the Court House Briefs. He searched the
whole page carefully, but there was no mention
of Pecos Dalhart, either with or without the
"Q." He pondered upon the fact during the
day—having nothing else to do—and when the
Friday paper came out with nothing about the
Hotel de Morgan in it he considered the matter
seriously. Then it came over him gradually—there
was nothing mysterious about it—the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
reporter was waiting for something to happen—a
kangaroo trial, or something like that.
Well, anything for a little excitement—why
not? There were lots of things to be remedied.
The yeggs had a dirty way of tapping on the
boiler-iron doors and singing lewd songs after
they were locked into their cells for the night,
a combination which broke in on his sleep; and
knowing that they were safe from his strap
they persisted in this amusement until they
could sing no more, stoutly denying all knowledge
of the disturbance in the morning. It
was the only revenge they could take on him
and they worked it to the limit. Not to be
outdone in the matter of revenge he drove
them like a pack of peons in the morning, forcing
them to do all the cleaning while his Mexican
friends rolled <i>cigarritos</i>—but that was
getting wearisome. Yet how easy it would be
to change! The verdict of a kangaroo jury is
always "Guilty"—why not accuse half the
yeggs of disturbing the peace, appoint the jury
from the other half, and let yegg nature do the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
rest? Then sentence the prisoners at the bar
to clean up for a week. Why not, indeed!</p>

<p>At supper time Pecos spoke a few invitational
words through the bars to Bill Todhunter
and about the time the boy reporter
from the <i>Blade</i> was due he placed his chair
against the doors and called his court to order.</p>

<p>"<i>Oyez! Oyez!</i> The Kangaroo Court of
Geronimo is now in session!" he announced, in
stentorian tones, and instantly the prisoners
began to assemble. "<i>Oyez</i>" was good Spanish
for "Hear!" and brought out all the Mexicans;
and the Americans came on the run,
eager for any excitement to pass the time away.</p>

<p>"Blacky," said Pecos, addressing the one-time
king of the yeggs, "bring the Chi Kid
before the bar of justice. He is accused of
disturbing the peace by singin' songs all night."</p>

<p>Without a moment's hesitation Philly Black
laid violent hands upon his friend and cellmate
and dragged him before the court. The
mandates of the law are inexorable; and besides,
Philly wanted the job of sheriff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come up here, Chi," he swaggered, fetching
Chi Kid around with a jerk, "now stand
there, or I'll punch youse in the jaw!" Chi
stood, reading his fate in every eye.</p>

<p>"Now, summon me a couple of witnesses!"
commanded Pecos, and as Blacky sifted
through the crowd looking for a pair of men
who could stand the Kid off later, Boone Morgan
and the boy reporter arrived from the
outer office and stood by to see the fun.</p>

<p>"Chi Kid," declaimed the judge, "you are
accused of singin' dirty songs all night and
disturbin' of the peace. Do you plead guilty
or not guilty?"</p>

<p>"Not guilty!" responded Chi, rolling his
evil eyes on the witnesses.</p>

<p>"Bring up them witnesses!" said Pecos
briefly. "Slim, did you hear the accused
singing' them dirty songs of his last night?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Yer Honor!" answered Denver Slim
dutifully, "and I couldn't hardly sleep—Yer
Honor!"</p>

<p>"Urr—it's too bad about you," commented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
the alcalde. "Bring up that other witness!"
The other witness had suffered a similar insomnia.
"That's all!" announced Pecos, with
finality, "got to hurry this case through now.
Got anything to say for yourse'f, prisoner?"</p>

<p>"I demand a jury trial!" growled the Kid.</p>

<p>"Too late for that now—the defendant is
found guilty and sentenced to clean up for a
week or git forty blows with the strap.
Sheriff, bring me Denver Slim!"</p>

<p>There was a genuine commotion at this, but
Philly Black produced the accused—he had
to, or lose his job.</p>

<p>"Denver Slim, you are accused of hammerin'
on your door all night and disturbin' of the
peace. Do you plead guilty or not guilty?"</p>

<p>Denver turned and made three successive
jabs at the jail sheriff, who had ruffled his feelings
from behind; then he drew himself up and
remarked:</p>

<p>"I don't plead!"</p>

<p>"'Don't plead' is the same as 'Not guilty,'"
said Pecos, remembering his experience with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
Pete Monat, "and more than that," he thundered,
"it's the same as contempt of court!
Mr. Sheriff, spread-eagle the prisoner over a
chair while I give him ten good ones for contempt—the
trial will then proceed!" He
rose from his chair and approached the defendant
warily, hefting his strap as he came,
and Denver became so deeply engrossed in
his movements that Philly Black closed with
him from the rear. There was a struggle,
gazed upon judicially by the alcalde, and at
last with a man on every arm and leg Denver
was laid sprawling over the back of the chair
while the prisoners gibbered with delight.
The blows were laid on soundly and yet with
a merciful indulgence and when the humiliating
ceremony was over Pecos had won every
heart but one. Denver Slim was sore, of
course; but how are you to have a Roman holiday
unless somebody else gets hurt? They
had a long and protracted jury trial after this,
with a fiery denunciation of law-breakers by
John Doe, the district attorney; and the verdict,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
of course, was "Guilty." Then they
kangarooed a few Mexicans to clean up their
side of the house and ended with a jubilee
chorus of "Kansas."</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
      <div class="verse">"I'll tell you what they do—<i>in Kansas</i>!"</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>It was great. There was a piece about it
in the paper the next morning and prospective
grand jurymen slapped their legs and
remarked, one to the other: "That Pecos Dalhart
is a proper fighting fool, ain't he? I
reckon Old Crit just jumped him into that
racket up the river in order to git him out of
the country. It's a dam' shame, too, when
you think how many Crit has stole!"</p>

<p>But alas, neither public praise nor blame
could open up the bars and let Pecos out of
jail. He was held by a power higher than
any man—the power of the Law, which, because
it has endured so long and is, in fact,
all we have, is deemed for that reason sacred.
And the law was busy—it is always busy—and
behind. Well, Pecos didn't know much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
about it, except what he had read in the <i>Voice
of Reason</i>, but as he heard the ponderous
wheels of the law grinding about him, saw
yeggs escape by cleverly devised tales and
Mexicans soaked because they were slow and
dumb, he wondered if that was the only way
they could make a stagger at justice. A
drunken cowboy had seized a gay man-about-town
and taken his pen-knife from his pocket—grand
larceny of the person, he was sentenced
to seven years. Another drunken
reprobate had beaten up the roustabout in a
saloon—and got thirty days for assault and
battery. Both drunk and both bad, but one
had played to hard luck. He had taken
property, the other had hurt a man. Pecos
saw when it was too late where he had marred
his game—he should have beaten Old Crit
instead of branding his calf.</p>

<p>In sombre silence he listened day by day
as the jail-lawyers—wise criminals who had
been in the toils before—cooked up stories to
explain away misdeeds; he watched day by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
day as the prisoners came down from their
trial, some with bowed heads or cursing
blindly, others laughing hysterically as they
scuttled out the door; and many a man who
had sworn to a lie went free where simple-minded
sinners plead guilty and took their
fate. Some there were who had boggled their
stories because their dull minds could not compass
the deceit; the district attorney had torn
them to flinders, raging and threatening them
with his finger for the perjured fools they were,
and the judge had given them the limit for
swearing to a lie. Even in jail it was the poor
and lowly who were punished, while the jail-lawyers
and those who could afford the petty
dollar that hired them took shelter behind the
law. Yes, it was all a game, and the best man
won—if he held the cards.</p>

<p>Slowly and with painstaking care Pecos
went over his own case, comparing it with these
others, and his heart sank as he saw where the
odds lay. The spotted calf was his—he
could swear to it—but it bore the brand of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
Crittenden and he had lost his bill of sale.
There were forty two-gun cowboys working
for Crit and any one of them would swear
him into jail for a drink—they had done it,
so he knew. José Garcia was afraid to tell
the truth and Crittenden would scare him
worse than ever before the trial took place.
Ah, that trial—it was more than five months
off yet and he could not stir a foot! Once outside
the bars and free-footed he could shake
up the dust; he could rustle up his witnesses
and his evidence and fight on an equality with
Crit. But no, the munneypullistic classes had
a bigger pull on him than ever, now—he was
jailed in default of bail and no one would put
up the price. God, what an injustice! A
rich man—a man with a single friend who
could put up a thousand dollars' bail—<i>he</i>
could go free, to hire his lawyers, look up his
witnesses, and fight his case in the open; but
a poor man—he must lay his condemned
carcass in jail and keep it there while the law
went on its way. Day by day now the prisoners
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
went to Yuma to serve their time, or
passed out into the world. But were those
who passed out innocent? The law said so,
for it set them free. And yet they were white
with the deadly pallor of the prison, their
hands were weak from inactivity, and their
minds poisoned by the vile company of yeggs;
they had lain there in the heat all summer
while judges went to the coast and grand jurymen
harvested their hay, and after all their
suffering, as a last and crowning flaunt, the
law had declared them innocent! It had been
many days since Pecos had seen the <i>Voice of
Reason</i> and he had lost his first enthusiasm
for the revolution, but nothing could make
him think that this was right. The Law was
like his kangaroo court, that travesty which he
made more villainous in order to show his scorn;
it laid hold upon the innocent and guilty and
punished them alike. Only the sturdy fighters,
like him, escaped—or the prisoners who
had their dollar. That was it—money!
And Pecos Dalhart had always been poor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<p>As the mills of the gods ground on, Pete
Monat, with his bandaged head, and Mike
Slattery, still nursing his battered jaw, were
removed from the bridal chamber, tried, and
lodged in the tanks for safety. Pete had
hired a shyster lawyer and got ten years in
Yuma; Mike had plead his own case and
escaped with only three. It was this last
lesson that Pecos conned in his heart. When
Slattery the yegg was arrested he had feigned
an overpowering drunkenness, and though the
case was all against him—he had been caught
in the act of burglarizing a lodging-house and
was loaded down with loot—he had nevertheless
framed up a good defence. With the
artless innocence of the skilled "moocher" he explained
to the court that while under the influence
of no less than seven drinks of straight
alcohol he had mistaken another gentleman's
room for his own and had gathered up his
wardrobe under the misapprehension that it
was his own. At every attempt to prove his
culpability he had represented that, beyond the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
main facts, his mind was a complete blank,
at the same time giving such a witty description
of the paralyzing effects of "Alki" that
even the district attorney had laughed. According
to Mike that was the way to get off
easy, be polite and respectful-like to the judge
and jury and jolly up the prosecuting attorney—and
in this contention the unfortunate
experience of Pete Monat clearly bore
him out. Pete had made the fatal mistake of
hiring, with two months' back pay, a "sucking
lawyer" who had so antagonized the district
attorney that that gentleman had become enraged,
making such a red-hot speech against
the damnable practice of horse-stealing—"a
crime, gentlemen of the jury, which, because
it may leave the innocent owner of that horse
to die of thirst on the desert, ought by rights
to be made a capital offence"—that poor Pete
was found guilty and sentenced before he could
build up a new defence.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't hold nothin' agin you, Pardner,"
he replied, in answer to Pecos's solicitude
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
for the influence of his battered head,
"the jury didn't cinch me for my looks—it's
that dam' narrer-headed jack-lawyer that I
got to thank f'r this. He wouldn't let me tell
my story, jest the way it was. You know,
an' I know, that when a man gits his time on
the range the boss is obligated to give him a
mount to town. How's a cowboy goin' to git
his riggin' to town—walk and pack his
saddle? Well, now, jest because I give old
Sage some back talk and quit him when he was
short-handed he told me to walk; an' me, like
the dam' fool I was, I went out and roped a
hoss instead. Then, jest to git even, he had
me arrested for a hoss-thief. But would this
pin-head of a lawyer hear to a straight talk
like that? No—he has me plead 'Not
guilty' and swear I never took the hoss—an'
you know the rest. That district attorney is
a mean devil—he won't let nobody stand
against him—you might as well plead 'Guilty'
and take the mercy of the court as to try
to buck against him. But whatever you do,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
Pardner, don't hire no tin-horn lawyer—I
give ten years of my life to find that out."
Pete sighed and rubbed his rough hands together
wearily—it would be long before they
felt the rope and the branding iron and the
hard usage of honest toil. A great pity came
over Pecos at the thought of his unhappy lot,
and he treated him kindly before the other
prisoners; but all the time a greater fear was
clutching at his heart. Pete had taken a horse,
but he had burned a calf—and Arizona hates
a rustler worse than it hates a horse-thief.
For all his strength and spirit, he was caught—caught
like a rat in a trap—and as the imminence
of his fate came over him he lost his
leonine bearing and became furtive, like the
rest of them. Outwardly he was the same,
and he ruled the jail with a rod of iron, but
at heart he was a true prisoner—cunning,
cringing, watchful, dangerous—all his faculties
centred upon that one thought, to escape!</p>

</div>

<p class="ac">THE LAW'S DELAY</p>

<p class="drop-cap">AS the first hot days of summer came on,
the district court of Geronimo County
closed; the judge, having decided each case
according to the law and the evidence, hurried
upon his way, well satisfied; the deputies took
a last disconsolate batch of prisoners to Yuma,
and Pecos Dalhart sat down to ponder on his
case. The tanks were nearly empty now, except
for the drunks and vags that the constables
brought in and the grist for the next
grand jury. It was a dreary grist, each man
swearing his innocence with unnatural warmth
until the general cynicism of the place shamed
him to silence. Pecos loathed them, the whining,
browbeaten slaves. After he had sounded
the depths of human depravity until there was
no more wickedness to learn he drew more and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
more aloof from his companions, thinking his
own thoughts in silence. When Boone Morgan
came in, or the <i>Blade</i> reporter, he conversed
with them, quietly and respectfully—Boone
Morgan could speak a word to the
judge, and Baker held the ear of the great
public. They were very kind to Pecos now,
and often, after some ingenious write-up of
his exploits, crowds of visitors would come to
stare at the grim rustler who ruled the Kangaroo
Court. There were no signs of the social
theorist about him now, and the revolution was
a broken dream—he could not afford such
dreams. Let the rich and the free hold fast
to their convictions and their faith—he was
trying to get out of jail.</p>

<p>The heat of midsummer came on apace, and
the sun, beating against the outer walls, turned
the close prison into an oven by day and a
black hole of misery at night. The palpitating
air seemed to press upon them, killing
the thought of sleep, and the prisoners moaned
and tossed in their bunks, or fell into fitful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
slumbers, broken by the high insistent whine
of mosquitoes or the curses of the vags. Of
curses there were a plenty before the cool
weather came, and protests and complaints,
but none from Pecos Dalhart. In the long
watches of the night he possessed his soul of
a mighty patience, to endure all things, if he
could only go free. Even with a jail missionary,
who distributed tracts and spoke bodingly
of a great punishment to come, he was patient;
and the missionary, poor simple man that he
was, proffered him in return the consolation
of religion. Being of a stiffnecked and perverse
generation Pecos declined to confess his
sins—the missionary might be subpœnaed by
the prosecution—but he listened with long-suffering
calm to the Prodigal Son, the Good
Samaritan, and the parable of the seeds that
were sown on stony ground. In themselves
the stories were good—nor were they strange
to Pecos, for his mother had been a good
Methodist—but the preacher spoiled them by
a too pointed application of the moral to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
own unfortunate case. Still, he let it go—anything
was better than listening to the yeggs—and
waited for the sermon to end. There
was a favor that he wanted to ask. Many
years ago—it was at camp-meeting and the
shouters were dancing like mad—he had
promised his sainted mother to read the Bible
through if she would quit agonizing over his
soul, but the promise he never kept. Small
print was hard on his young eyes that were
so quick to see a cow, and he put the matter
off until such a time as he should break a leg
or get sick or otherwise find time to spare.
Well, he had all the time there was, now, and
it would give him something to do.</p>

<p>"Say, Pardner," he observed, as the missionary
pressed a sheaf of tracts upon him at
parting, "is this the best you can do? I was
powerful interested in them stories—how
about a Bible?"</p>

<p>Bibles were a scarce article in those parts,
but Pecos got one, and after laying bets with
various flippant prisoners, he read it from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
cover to cover, religiously. Then, just to show
his bringing up, he went back and read over
all the big wars and fights and the troubles of
Moses in the wilderness. Still there was time
to spare and he read of Daniel and Nehemiah
and the prophets who had cried unto Israel.
It was a poor beginning, but somehow when he
was reading the Bible he forgot the heat and
the vileness of the jail and won back his self-respect.
In that long catalogue of priests
and prophets and leaders of the people what
one was there, from Joseph to Jesus, who had
not been cast into prison? The universality
of their fate seemed to cheer him and give him
something in common—perhaps they were of
some kin with the apostles of the revolution.
And in the long, suffocating nights he would
think back to the mud-streaked adobe house
that he had called home and hear his mother
patting softly on her knees and singing: "Oh,
come to Jesus, come to Jesus—" with a little
Texas <i>yupe</i> at the end of every line. So he
wore the summer's heat away, and with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
return of cool weather his mind went back to
his case.</p>

<p>There was no use trying to do anything before
the grand jury, so everybody said; that
great bulwark of the people generally indicted
every one that the district attorney shook his
finger at and let the judge find out later
whether he was innocent—that was his business,
anyway. Besides—whatever else he
did—Pecos was going to be careful not to
offend the district attorney. The sad case of
Pete Monat, who must have put in an awful
summer at Yuma, was ever in his mind, and
while he would not go so far as to plead guilty
in order to accommodate the choleric Mr. Kilkenny,
he was firmly resolved not to antagonize
him in the trial. He had money, too—five
months' wages, deposited with the sheriff—but
a hundred and fifty dollars would not hire
a man who could stand up against District Attorney
Kilkenny, the terror of evil-doers. As
a man, Shepherd Kilkenny was all right—a
devoted husband, a loving father, all the other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
good things you read on a gravestone—but
as a prosecuting attorney he was a devil. At
every biennial election he got all the votes there
were on his court record. He convicted everybody—except
a few whose friends had worked
a rabbit's foot for them—and convicted them
beyond appeal. That saved money to the
county. His reputation for convictions was
so great that most of the petty criminals pled
guilty and came down like Davey Crockett's
coon, before he had a chance to shoot. That
expedited the court calendar and saved thousands
of dollars in fees and witness expenses—another
good thing for the honest tax-payer.
In fact, everything that Shepherd Kilkenny
did was for the benefit of the Geronimo tax-payers,
and Yuma was crowded with convicts
to prove that he knew his business. That was
what he was hired for—to convict law-breakers—and
if he let a single guilty man
escape he was recreant to his trust. Kilkenny
had a stern sense of civic responsibility—he
got them, if it took a leg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<p>There had been a time when Shepherd Kilkenny
believed that every man who had the
price was innocent. That was when, as a rising
young lawyer, he was defending criminals
in the courts; and he threw so many miscreants
loose and made such a show of old Trusdale,
the former district attorney, that the community
in a burst of popular indignation put the
old man out and gave Kilkenny his job. At
this Kilkenny brought out an entirely new set
of adjectives, changed all his fixed opinions in
a day, and, being now in a position to square
himself with the real Law, which holds that a
man is guilty until he can prove himself innocent,
he became a flaming sword against the
transgressor. His conversion also enabled him
to slough off the old pathetic-fallacy line of
talk that he had been called upon to use in
pleading before a jury and to adopt a more
dignified and denunciatory style, a cross between
Demosthenes and the Daniel Webster
school. The prosperous life of a politician jollied
him up a bit, too; he developed a certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
sardonic humor in the handling of unfavorable
witnesses, and got off a good one every once in
a while for the benefit of the reporters. But
there was one thing that Shepherd Kilkenny
could not tolerate, and that was another rising
young criminal lawyer trying to defeat the
ends of justice and beat him out of his job.
Yuma was full of Pete Monats who had fallen
victims to this feud, and Pecos resolved to
plead his case himself before he would take
chances on a sucking lawyer.</p>

<p>It was while he was in this vacillating mood
and feeling mighty lonely and lost to the world
that he heard late one night a familiar whoop
from the jag-cell, followed by a fiery oration in
the vernacular. It was Angy, down for his
periodical drunk, and Pecos could hardly wait
to clasp him by the hand. It was a peculiar
thing about Angevine Thorne—the drunker
he got the more his language improved, until
in the ecstasy of his intoxication, he often
quoted Greek and Latin, or words deemed by
local wiseacres to be derived from those sources.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
Drink also seemed to clarify his vision and give
him an exalted sense of truth, justice, and
man's inhumanity to man. It had been his
custom in the past at this climacteric stage of
inebriation to mount upon some billiard table
or other frangible piece of saloon furniture and
deliver temperance lectures until removed by
the police. But times had changed with Geronimo's
champion booze-fighter and in his later
prepossessions he grappled with the mighty
problem of wealth and its relation to the common
man. There are some hard sayings in
the <i>Voice of Reason</i> against the privileged
classes, but they are all nicely considered in
relation to the libel law, whereas Angy had
no such compunctions. Having spent all his
money for drink and received a jail sentence
for life, the law had no further terrors for him
and he turned his eloquence loose. It was a
wild rave when Pecos heard it, and grew progressively
more incoherent; but as he lay in
his bunk and listened to the familiar appeals a
thought came to Pecos like an inspiration from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
the gods—why not turn that stream of eloquence
into profitable channels and make
Angy his advocate? There was not a voter in
Geronimo who did not know Babe Thorne and
love him for his foolishness—the life sentence
which he suffered for conspicuous drunkenness
was but a token of their regard, placing him
above the level of common ordinary drunks
even as his eloquence placed him above the
maudlin orators with whom the saloons were
crowded. He was a character, a standing
jest—and Arizona loves a joke better than
life itself. Above all, Angy was a good fellow—he
could jolly the district attorney and make
him laugh! They would win their case and
then he would be free—free! Pecos could
not sleep from thinking of it and he begged
Bill Todhunter, as a special favor, to bring
Babe in from the jag-cell at once.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" inquired Bill casually,
"are you gettin' interested in yore girl?
I hear Old Crit has cut you out."</p>

<p>"Crit be damned!" cried Pecos. "Have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
I ever asked you for anything before? Well
then, throw him in here, can't you?"</p>

<p>The deputy did as he was bid and went
away—he was not of a prying disposition and
Pecos had saved him a lot of trouble. There
had never been an alcalde like Pecos Dalhart.
No, indeed—it would rustle them to get one
half as good when he went his way to Yuma.</p>

<p>The conference with Angevine Thorne, attorney-at-law,
was long, and private, but as
Angy sobered up he beheld greater and greater
possibilities in the matter; and when he went
away he assured his client that within the
calendar month he should step forth a free
man—free as the prairie wind. He was confident
of it, and upon his departure Pecos gave
him fifty dollars to use with José Garcia. Also
he was to find Old Funny-face, the mother of
the calf, if it took the last cow in the barn. But
all was to be conducted quietly, very quietly,
for if Old Crit ever got wind of any defence
he would frame up a case to disprove it. To
be sure, José Garcia was in debt several hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
dollars to Isaac Crittenden—and afraid
of his life, to boot—but for fifty dollars cash
Joe would swear to anything, even the truth;
and if by so doing he got Pecos out—why,
there was a man who could protect him against
Crit and all his cowboys. It looked good to
Angevine Thorne and, as an especial inducement
to Joe to stay put, he swore by all the
saints to have his life if he dared to go back
on his agreement. Then, very quietly, he instituted
a search for Old Funny-face and, having
located her up the river with a tame bunch
of cattle, he came away, knowing full well
that he could produce her at the proper time.
There would be a little surprise coming to
Isaac Crittenden when he went to court next
week and, being actuated by no feeling of false
delicacy in dealing with such a reptile, Angy
went back to work for him and watched the
conspiracy breed.</p>

<p>It was a constant source of surprise to the
transient public to observe how a man with
so many disagreeable qualities kept the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
men working for him year after year; but to
those who knew Crittenden well it was as
natural as hunger and thirst. In fact, it was
intimately connected with hunger and thirst.
Any time that Joe Garcia wanted to quit he
could just tell his wife and six children to stop
eating, tie his things in a handkerchief, and
walk down the road. José was ruled by
hunger and the slavish peon spirit of a Mexican—Babe
and the cowboys were ruled by
thirst. No matter how many times he had
been fired or quit, a man could always get a
chance to work for nothing with Crit; and so
long as he spent all his money at the store
Crittenden was even willing to pay him good
wages in the busy season. Babe was the
easiest mark he had as far as money was concerned,
and, being so well educated withal, the
illiterate cowman found him almost indispensable
as a letter-writer and book-keeper. So
far, so good—but why did Babe, with his classical
education, insist upon donating his services
to a man who treated him so despitefully?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
Ah, it was a hard question, but even a vagrant
likes to have some place, no matter how unlovely,
which can take the place of a home.
Yet for the six long months that Pecos had
lain in jail Angy had had reason enough for
staying—Marcelina needed him, and she
needed him bad.</p>

<p>Every month seemed to add some new grace
and beauty to the daughter of José Garcia—the
primitive beauty that seems to bud like a
flower beneath the Arizona sun; the beauty of
the young Apache maiden and the slender
<i>Hija de Mejico</i>, that comes to its perfection
so soon and is doomed so often to fade away
prematurely before the lust of men. In another
place Marcelina's face might have been
her fortune, but at Verde Crossing it was her
bane. The cowboys lingered about the store
to gaze upon her boldly or stepped outside to
intercept her on her way; and Joe, poor tortoise-brained
Joe, did not live up to his full
duty as a father. The <i>Texano</i> cowboys were
a fierce breed and impatient of restraint—also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
they held a Mexican to be something
below a snake. He was afraid of them, though
he rolled his fat eyes and frowned—but most
of all he feared Old Crit. Ah, there was a
man to fear—Ol' Creet—and he held him in
his power, him and all his little flock. Day
after day, as the summer passed, the Boss
kept after him, and but for his woman he
would have given way. How she did curse
him, the <i>Señora</i>, his <i>mujer</i>, and how she did
curse Crit—but most of all she cursed their
poverty, which exposed her child to such a fate.
Even the few <i>pesos</i> to send her to the school
were lacking—Marcelina must stay at Verde
Crossing and fight against her fate. There
was only one man who would stand by them,
and that was Babe. Only for the one time in
six months had Babe been drunk, and that was
when Crit was away. He had left them his
pistols at parting and hurried back, after he
had seen Pecos in the jail. Yet after all it
was worth the risk, for Babe had brought back
money—yes, money, fifty dollars in bills—and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
he offered it all to José if he would stand
up and tell the truth. What a coward—that
foolish José! For a week he weighed his manhood
in the balance and was afraid—and then
Babe had given him two drinks, quick, and
made him promise, and given the money to his
<i>mujer</i>. <i>Madre de Dios</i>, it was accomplished,
and the day that Crittenden and his cowboys
rode away to Geronimo to testify before the
grand jury the Señora Garcia followed far
behind in the broken-down buggy, and when
the town was dark she drove in and left
Marcelina at the Sisters' school.</p>

</div>

<p class="ac">THE LAST CHANCE</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE was a hot time in old Geronimo
on the night that Ike Crittenden and
his cowboys rode in, and in spite of everything
he could do three of them wound up in the jag-cell
before morning. Nevertheless he had
plenty of witnesses and to spare, for the grand
jury merely went over the same evidence that
had been taken before the magistrate and
handed down an indictment against Pecos Dalhart,
accusing him of feloniously and unlawfully
marking, branding, or altering the brand
on one neat animal, to wit, a spotted calf, belonging
to Isaac Crittenden of Verde Crossing.
It was almost the first case on the calendar
and the arraignment was set for the following
Monday. Then Pecos Dalhart, defendant,
slouched gloomily back to his cell and sat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
down to await the issue. The howls of Angevine
Thorne, blended with the hoarse protests
of Crit's cowboys, floated in to him from the
jag-cell and he knew his faithful attorney had
not deserted him, but what a broken reed was
that to lean on when his whole future hung in
the balance! Even as he listened he had an
uneasy fear that Angy was giving the whole
snap away to the drunken cowboys and once
more he begged Bill Todhunter to throw Babe
into the tanks where he could look after him.
It was at this time, when things were at their
worst, that Shepherd Kilkenny, the district attorney,
came down to look into his case and
find out how he would plead.</p>

<p>He was a very cautious man, Mr. Kilkenny,
and he never had a man indicted unless he held
his written confession or knew beyond the peradventure
of a doubt that he could convict him.
In the case of Pecos Dalhart he had been unusually
careful, for it was the first case of
cattle stealing to come before him and most of
his constituents were in the cow business; therefore,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
not to take any chances, he had followed
it from the magistrate's court to the secret
chambers of the grand jury, and now he was
going after a confession. He came with gifts,
a brace of cigars, but Pecos was well supplied
with cigarette makings and waved them courteously
aside. Then they got down to business.</p>

<p>"Mr. Dalhart," began Kilkenny, "I'm the
district attorney and I've come to talk over
your case with you—in a friendly way, you
understand. Ah—have you engaged an attorney?
No? Well, that is hardly necessary,
you know, but if you do call in a counsellor I
am sure he will advise you to plead 'Guilty.'
Ahem—yes, indeed. There's many a man
stole his calf and got away with it, but you
were caught in the act and observed by twenty
witnesses. Not the ghost of a chance, you
see; but if you plead 'Guilty' and throw yourself
upon the mercy of the court it will cut
your sentence in half, probably more. I'm
a friend of yours, Mr. Dalhart, and I've often
heard the sheriff speak of your exemplary character
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
as a prisoner. All these things are appreciated,
you know, and I—well, I'll do all
I can for you with the judge. Now all you
have to do is to sign this little paper and—"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," said Pecos, thrusting the
paper back, "and I sure take it kindly of you,
Mr. Kilkenny, but I can't plead 'Guilty'—not
to please nobody—because I'm <i>not</i> guilty."</p>

<p>"Not guilty!" The district attorney
laughed. "Why, you were taken in the act,
Mr. Dalhart. I never saw a more conclusive
line of evidence."</p>

<p>"Well," grumbled Pecos, "if I was guilty
I'd sure plead 'Guilty,' you can bank on that.
But this blankety-blank, Ike Crittenden, has
jest framed up a lot of evidence to railroad
me to the pen—and them cowboys of his
would swear to anything for the drinks. You
wouldn't soak a man on evidence like that,
would you, Mr. District Attorney?"</p>

<p>"I'd soak him on any evidence I could get,"
responded the district attorney succinctly.
"You know my reputation, Mr. Dalhart—I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
convict every man that pleads 'Not
guilty'!"</p>

<p>"But s'pose he isn't guilty!" cried Pecos.</p>

<p>"I convict him anyway!" replied the district
attorney. "Are you going to sign this, or are
you going ahead like a damned fool and get
the limit in Yuma?"</p>

<p>"I won't sign it," said Pecos firmly.</p>

<p>"Very well," responded Kilkenny, closing
his little book with a snap. He rose to his full
height and pursed his lips ominously. "Very
well, Mr. Dalhart!" he said, nodding and
blinking his eyes. "Very well, sir!" Then
he retired, leaving so much unsaid that it threw
Pecos into a panic. In a very real picture he
could see himself sitting in the shade of a big
adobe wall and making State's-prison bridles
for life. He could see the guards pacing back
and forth on top of the bastions and Pete
Monat holding one end of a horse-hair strand
while he swung a little trotter and twisted the
loose hairs into the other end, forever and forever.
It was awful. The full sense of his impending
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
doom rushed in upon him and he laid
hold of the sodden Babe who was maundering
about the revolution, and shook him frantically.</p>

<p>"My God, Angy," he cried, "wake up and
do something! Fergit about the common
people and do something for <i>me</i>! Fergit that
you ever had any principles and he'p me fight
that low-lived dastard or I'll go to Yuma for
life!"</p>

<p>"The voice of the people shall rule in the
land!" pronounced Angy oracularly.</p>

<p>"To hell with the people!" yelled Pecos.
"It's the People that's tryin' to send me up!
Do you want me to git twelve years for
brandin' that spotted calf? Well, wake up,
then, and git yore wits to work!"</p>

<p>Angy woke up, by degrees, but his wits would
not work. The ecstasy of intoxication was past
and his mind was a legal blank for the remainder
of that day. The day was Friday,
and Pecos had to plead on Monday—"Guilty"
or "Not guilty." "Guilty" meant six or eight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
years in prison; "Not guilty" meant twelve
years—or freedom. It was a gamble, but he
would risk it if Angy would remain sober
enough to talk. His only chance of freedom
lay in his friend's misdirected eloquence, and
when Babe was entirely himself Pecos backed
him up into a corner and talked to him with
tears in his voice.</p>

<p>"Never, never, never—" began Angy, holding
up his hand to swear; but Pecos stopped
him with a sign.</p>

<p>"Nothing like that, Pardner," he said.
"You been breakin' that pledge for forty
years. Jest look me in the eye now and
promise me you won't tech a drop until I'm
free."</p>

<p>"All right, Pecos," agreed Angy, "I'll do it,
I won't touch a drop till you're free."</p>

<p>"And when I'm free," continued Pecos,
"I'll stake you to a drunk from which Geronimo
will sure date time. Now let's git down
to business."</p>

<p>The details of that campaign against the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
People were talked over in hushed secrecy and
when on Monday morning Pecos appeared
before the stern judge to plead, Angevine
Thorne stood just within the rail, shuffling his
worn hat nervously.</p>

<p>"I will call the case of the People versus
Pecos Dalhart," said the judge. "Pecos Dalhart,
to the charge of grand larceny do you
plead 'Guilty' or 'Not guilty'?"</p>

<p>"'Not guilty,' Your Honor!" responded
Pecos.</p>

<p>"The defendant enters a plea of 'Not
guilty,'" observed the judge impassively.
"Are you represented by counsel, Mr. Dalhart?"</p>

<p>"No, Your Honor," replied Pecos.</p>

<p>"You understand, do you not, that in case
you are unable to employ an attorney the
court will appoint one to advise you, free of
charge?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Your Honor," answered Pecos, "but
if it's all the same to you I'd rather not have
a lawyer. I'd like to ask a favor, Judge, if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
you don't mind. The reason I don't want an
attorney appointed is that I know very well
none of these lawyers around here can stand
up to the district attorney when it comes to
a case of law"—here Kilkenny smiled grimly
to himself and glanced at Mr. Baker of the
<i>Blade</i>—"but at the same time, Judge, I do
want some one to speak for me, and I'm goin'
to ask you to appoint my friend Mr. Thorne,
back there, as my counsellor."</p>

<p>"Mr. Thorne?" inquired the judge, and as
Angy stepped forward, smirking and bowing,
a slight smile broke up the fine legal lines
on the judicial brows. At no time was Angy
over-fastidious about his attire, and a night in
jail, particularly in the jag-cell, is warranted
to spoil the appearance of the finest suit of
clothes that was ever made. Angy's clothes
were old and worn; his shirt was greasy around
the neck, and his overalls, hanging loosely about
his hips, piled up in slovenly rolls above his
shoe-tops; his hat, from much fanning of open
fires, was grimed with ashes and whitened with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
splashes of sour dough, and his shiny bald
head and red face told all too plainly the story
of his past. In the titter that followed his
announcement he stood silent, rolling his
bloodshot eyes upon the audience, but as the
grinning bailiff smote the table for order he
turned with the dignity of an orator and addressed
the judge.</p>

<p>"Your Honor," he said, beginning the set
speech which he had prepared, "I am not unaware
that this request on the part of the defendant
is a little irregular, but if the court
please I should like to state the reasons—"</p>

<p>"Just a moment!" cut in the district attorney
brusquely. "Your Honor, I object to
this man being appointed to the position of
counsellor on the ground that he is not a duly-licensed
attorney and therefore not competent
to practise in this court."</p>

<p>"As I am tendering my services without
hope of compensation," observed Angy
suavely, "and also without submitting briefs or
other legal papers, I hope that the court will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
overlook this trifling irregularity. The law
referred to by the district attorney, as applied
to this case, was intended solely to protect the
defendant in his rights, the inference being
that no one not a regularly practising attorney
is competent to adequately represent the defendant
against the learned district attorney"—Angy
bowed to that gentleman—"but
at the same time, Your Honor, I wish
to say that in days gone by I have stood
before the bar"—the bailiff struck his gavel
to quiet the sudden laughter—"I have stood
before the bar of justice, Your Honor, and I
have stood there, sir, not as Angevine Thorne,
the drunkard, but as a regular practitioner in
that court. I submit, Your Honor, that I
am fully qualified, both by past experience and
present information, to represent Mr. Dalhart
in this unfortunate case!"</p>

<p>A murmur of astonishment passed around
the room at this revelation of his past; for while
Angevine Thorne had been about Geronimo,
drunk and sober, for over twenty years, he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
never referred except in the vaguest terms to
the life which he had left behind. It struck
wonder into the breasts of the court-room bums,
many of whom had shared the jag-cell with him
in times past, and Mr. Baker of the <i>Blade</i> sank
down into a seat and began to write hurriedly
upon his pad; but Shepherd Kilkenny, with a
sudden premonition of what Angy's "present
information" might lead to, did not yield himself
to any such puny emotion as surprise. He
was a fighter, and a sure-thing fighter to boot.</p>

<p>"Your Honor!" he cried, "I wish to protest
most—"</p>

<p>"Objection is overruled!" interposed the
judge. "I see no reason why Mr. Thorne
should not conduct this case if the defendant
so wishes, and the clerk will enter him accordingly.
Would Wednesday be too soon for you
to prepare your argument, Mr. Thorne? Is
it satisfactory to you, Mr. Kilkenny? Very
well, then, I will set the case for Wednesday,
the eighth of October, at ten <span class="sc">A. M.</span> Call the
next case, Mr. Bailiff!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span></p>

<p>The bailiff called it, still smiling, and in the
pause half the occupants of the court-room
boiled out onto the court-house lawn and gave
vent to their pent-up emotions. Babe Thorne
was going to buck Kilkenny and plead a case
in court! He would make an impassioned appeal
and raise Cain with Ike Crittenden's
witnesses—it would be an event never to be
forgotten! Still laughing they scattered
through the town, and soon men came hurrying
forth from the different saloons to verify the report;
they gathered in a crowd by the sheriff's
office and, as the word spread that it was true,
gangs of cowboys and men on livery-stable
plugs went dashing down the streets, whooping
and laughing and crying the news to their
friends. It was a new excitement—something
doing—and the way an Arizona town
will take on over some such trifling event is
nothing short of scandalous. Within two hours
the leisure male population of Geronimo was
divided into two hostile camps—those who
would get Babe drunk before the event and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
those who would keep him sober and have him
take a fall out of Kilkenny. On the one side it
was argued that, unless he was properly ginned
up, Babe would not do justice to the occasion;
but cooler heads won on the proposition that
the judge would bar him if he got drunk and
hollered, and a committee of prominent citizens
was organized to protect him from himself.</p>

<p>Being quick to see the news value of the incident
the <i>Blade</i> printed an exclusive interview
with Angevine Thorne—formerly of the
Kentucky bar—and announced that the trial
would be covered in detail by "our Mr.
Baker." A series of Communications, written
under pressure in the card-rooms of various
casinos, expressed the greatest indignation at
the "dastardly attempt of a certain interested
party to debar Mr. Thorne from the trial," and
the hope that this exhibition of professional
jealousy would receive the rebuke it so richly
deserved. In an editorial the <i>Daily Blade</i>
spoke at some length of the rare eloquence of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
"our gifted fellow-citizen, Colonel Thorne,"
and felicitated Alcalde Dalhart upon the
acumen he had shown in retaining counsel.
Everything goes, in a case like that, and the
<i>Blade</i> played it up to the limit.</p>

<p>As night came on a select circle of visitors
gathered at the county jail to witness the
kangaroo trial of two more of Crit's cowboys
who had unwittingly placed themselves in the
power of Pecos Dalhart. The summary punishment
of the first three—the ones who had
occupied the jag-cell with Angevine Thorne—had
been heralded far and wide as an example
of poetic justice, but the grim humor of
this last arraignment set the town in an uproar.
Within two days these same booze-fighting
cowboys would appear against him in
the upper court, but of that event Pecos Dalhart
took no thought and he kangarooed them
to a finish. It was good business, as the actors
say, and won him many a friend, for Arizona
loves a sport—but after they had been
spread-eagled over a chair and received twenty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
blows for contempt of court, the cowboys were
ready to take their oath to anything. That
was it—Pecos might win the hearts of the
people and still go down before the law and
the evidence. Only two things cheered him on—Angy
and Bill Todhunter had gone up the
river for Old Funny-face, and Joe Garcia was
in town. After Crit had sworn himself into
perdition over the calf they would spring
Funny-face on him—Mexican brands and all—and
show that he was a liar. Then José
Garcia would testify to the sale of Funny-face
and her calf and the rest would go off
in a canter. It was a pleasing dream, and
Pecos indulged it to the full, for it was the only
hope he had. But the next morning he was
nervous.</p>

<p>It was the day before his trial and even his
six months in jail had not taught him to be
patient. As soon as the cells were unlocked
he began to pace up and down the corridor like
a caged lion, scowling and muttering to himself.
To the stray visitors who dropped in he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
was distant but civil, as befits a man who must
act his part, but all the time a growing uneasiness
was gnawing at his heart and he
looked past them to the outer door. Hours
dragged by and his uneasiness changed into
despair; he hurled himself upon his bunk and
was lying with his haggard face to the bars
when the jail deputy entered and gazed in
upon him curiously.</p>

<p>"They's a lady out here to see you," he
whispered, laying his finger along his nose
with an air of roguish secrecy, "shall I bring
her in? She's got something she wants to
give you!"</p>

<p>A vision of the unbalanced females who had
been bringing flowers to a murderer came over
Pecos and he debated swiftly with himself
whether to accept this last humiliation or plead
a sudden indisposition.</p>

<p>"She's been waiting around all the morning,"
continued the deputy. "Kinder shy, I
reckon—shall I bring 'er in? She's a Mex!"</p>

<p>A Mex! The word shocked Pecos like a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
blow; it made him glad, and then it made him
angry.</p>

<p>"Well, what's the matter with a Mex?" he
demanded sharply. "Ain't a Mexican got no
rights in this dam' jail? I guess she's as good
as any white woman—show her in!"</p>

<p>He waited in palpitating silence, and when
the soft rustle of skirts sounded down the corridor
his heart stopped beating entirely. Then
Marcelina pressed her face against the
screened bars and gazed wistfully into the
darkened cell. She had grown taller since he
last saw her and her dark eyes had taken on a
look of infinite melancholy; the rare promise
of her youth had flowered suddenly in his absence
and she stood before him a woman.
Often in his dreams he had thought of her, but
always as the black-eyed girl, saucy and fugitive
as a bird, who had bewitched him with her
childish graces; now she peered in at him
through the prison bars with the eyes of a
woman who has suffered and found her soul.
For a moment she gazed into the darkness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
and then she drew back involuntarily. The
Pecos she had known was a grown-up boy,
grim and quick in speech but full of the reckless
fire of youth; a dashing cowboy, guiding
his horse by a touch of the hand and riding,
riding, always. Here was a hard-faced man,
pale and bowed by confinement, and his eyes
were like a starved animal's. She started and
bit her lip.</p>

<p>"Are you Paycos?" she asked timidly.</p>

<p>The bitterness of his fate swept over Pecos
at the words—he looked down at his crumpled
clothes, his outworn boots, and faded shirt
and rumbled in his throat.</p>

<p>"No, Marcelina," he said, "I'm only a
caged wolf—a coyote that the vaqueros have
roped and tied and fastened to a tree. I'm a
hard-looker, all right—how'd you come to
find me?"</p>

<p>She laid a brown hand against the bars as
if in protest and motioned him nearer the
screen.</p>

<p>"I have only been in town four days," she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
said hurriedly. "All summer I was shut up
at Verde, and Ol' Creet—ah, that bad, ba-ad
man! My mother took me to school the day
he come to Geronimo. I am 'fraid, Paycos—but
this morning I run away to see you. The
seesters will be hunt for me now. Look Paycos"—she
thrust her hand into the bosom of
her dress and drew forth a small bundle,
wrapped in a blue silk handkerchief—"<i>Cuidado</i>,
be careful," she whispered; "when I
keess you good-bye at the door I weel put thees
een your hand—<i>ssst!</i>" She turned and
looked up the corridor where the deputy was
doing the Sherlock. He was a new man—the
jail deputy—just helping out during the
session of the court and correspondingly impressed
with his own importance. Nothing
larger than a darning-needle could be passed
through the heavy iron screen, but all the same
he kept his eye on them, and when he saw the
quick thrust of her hand all the suspicions of
the amateur sleuth rushed over him at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hey! What's that?" he demanded, striding
down the run-around. "What you got hid
there, eh?" He ogled Marcelina threateningly
as he stood over her and she shrank before
his glance like a school-girl. "Come,
now," he blustered, "show me what that is or
I'll take it away from you. We don't allow
anything to be passed in to the prisoners!"</p>

<p>"She can't pass nothin' through here!" interposed
Pecos, tapping on the screen. "You
haven't got nothin', have you, Marcelina?"</p>

<p>"Well, I saw her hide something blue in her
dress just now," persisted the jailer, "and I
want to see it, that's all!"</p>

<p>"It was—it was only a handkerchief!"
sobbed Marcelina, clutching at her breast.
"No, no! Eet is mine—he—he geev it to
me! You can not—" she choked, and backed
swiftly toward the door. Like a panther
Pecos whipped out of his cell and sprang
against the corridor grating, but she was gone.
The deputy made a futile grab as she darted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
away from him and sprang after her, but she
swung the great door in his face and sped like
a deer down the hall. The next moment she
was gone, leaving Pecos and the deputy to
have it out together.</p>

<p>"Aha!" cried the deputy vengefully, "you
will try to smuggle things in, will you? I'll
report this matter to Mr. Morgan at once!"</p>

<p>"Well, report it, then, you low-flung hound!"
wailed Pecos, "report it, and be damned to
you! But if I was outside these bars I'd beat
you to death for this!" They raged up and
down the grating, snarling at each other like
dogs that fight through a lattice, and even
when Boone Morgan came and called them
down Pecos would not be appeased.</p>

<p>"He scairt my girl away!" he cried, scowling
menacingly at the raw deputy. "She come
to give me a handkerchief and he jumped at
her. I'll fix him, the dastard, if ever I git a
chance!" And so he raged and stormed until
they went away and left him, mystified. To
Boone Morgan it seemed as if his alcalde was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
raising a row out of all proportion to his grievance,
but that was because Pecos could not
explain his woes. Marcelina had promised to
kiss him good-bye, and the damned deputy had
intervened!</p>

<p class="ac">THE LAW AND THE EVIDENCE</p>

<p class="drop-cap">AS the rising sun poured its flood of
glorious light into the court-house
square and the janitor, according to his custom,
threw open the court-room doors to sweep,
there was a scuffling of eager feet from without
and the swift-moving pageantry of the
Dalhart trial began. A trio of bums who
had passed the night <i>al fresco</i> on the park
benches hustled past the astounded caretaker
and bestowed themselves luxuriously on the
front seats. As the saloons opened up and
discharged their over-night guests others of
the brotherhood drifted in and occupied the
seats behind, and by the time the solid citizens
of Geronimo had taken care of their stock,
snatched their breakfasts, and hurried to the
scene there was standing room only in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
teeming chamber of justice. Only the special
venire of jurymen took their time in the matter
and the sweating bailiff had to pass them
in through the side door in order to get them
seated inside the railing. At nine-thirty
Boone Morgan brought in the defendant,
freshly shaven and with his hair plastered
down across his forehead, and sat with him
near the jail door. It was all in the line of
duty, but there were those who remarked that
it was right clever of old Boone to throw in
that way with his jail alcalde. Some people
would have put the nippers on him for the
cow-thief that he was, and chained him to a
deputy. Behind them, the cynosure of all
eyes, sat the counsel for the defendant, Angevine
Thorne, his round baby face illuminated
with the light of a great resolve. On that day
he was going to save his friend from prison or
climb spider-webs in the attempt. A hush
fell over the assembly as the hour of trial drew
near and only the gaunt figure of Shepherd
Kilkenny, pacing up and down before the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
empty jury-box, suggested the battle that
was to come. The rest was as pathetic as the
Angelus.</p>

<p>The soft morning breeze breathed in through
the windows and as Pecos glimpsed the row
of horses tied to the hitching rack he filled his
lungs deep with the sweet air, and sighed.
The invalid who has been confined to his room
longs vaguely for the open air, but to the
strong man of action, shut up for months in
a close cell, the outer world seems like a dream
of paradise and he sees a new heaven in the
skies. In the tense silence of waiting the
tragedy in his face afflicted the morbid crowd
and made them uneasy; they shifted their eyes
to the stern, fighting visage of the district attorney
and listened hopefully for the clock.
It struck, slowly and with measured pauses,
and as the last stroke sounded through the hall
the black curtain behind the bench parted
and the judge stepped into court. Then instantly
the sheriff's gavel came down upon the
table; the People rose before the person of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
Law, and in sonorous tones Boone Morgan repeated
the ancient formula for the calling of
the court.</p>

<p>"<i>Oyez! Oyez! Oyez!</i> The District Court
of Geronimo County is now in session!"</p>

<p>The judge threw off his robes and sat down
and as the audience sank back into their
crowded seats he cast one swift, judicial glance
at the defendant, the clerk, and the district attorney
and called the case of Pecos Dalhart,
charged with the crime of grand larceny.
With the smoothness of well-worn machinery
the ponderous wheels of justice began to turn,
never halting, never faltering, until the forms
prescribed by law had been observed. One
after the other, the clerk called the names of
the forty talesmen, writing each name on a slip
of paper as the owner answered "Here"; then
at a word from the judge he placed the slips in
a box and shook out twelve names upon the
table. As his name was called and spelled
each talesman rose from his seat and shambled
over to the jury-box, turning his solemn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
face from the crowd. They held up their right
hands and swore to answer truthfully all questions
relative to their qualifications as jurors,
and sat down to listen to the charges; then,
after reading the information upon which the
accusations were based, the district attorney
glanced shrewdly at the counsel for defendant
and called the first juryman. The battle had
begun.</p>

<p>The first talesman was a tall, raw-boned
individual with cowman written all over him,
and the district attorney was careful not to
ask his occupation. He wanted a jury of
twelve cowmen, no less; and, knowing every
man in the venire either by sight or reputation,
he laid himself out to get it.</p>

<p>"Mr. Rambo," he began, "do you know the
defendant in this case?" He indicated Pecos
Dalhart with a contemptuous wave of the hand,
and Mr. Rambo said he did not. "Know anything
about this case?"</p>

<p>"Only what I read in the papers," responded
the cowman dryly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span></p>

<p>"You don't believe everything you read, do
you, Mr. Rambo? If you were passed for a
juror you wouldn't let anything you have read
influence your mind, if it was proven that the
defendant was guilty, would you?"</p>

<p>"No, sir!"</p>

<p>"If I should prove to your satisfaction that
the defendant here"—another contemptuous
wave of the hand—"had wilfully and feloniously
stolen and branded the animal in question,
what would your verdict be—'Guilty' or
'Not guilty'?"</p>

<p>"W'y—er—'Guilty'!"</p>

<p>"Pass the juror!" snapped the district attorney,
and then he looked at the counsel for
the defendant as if imploring him not to waste
any of the court's valuable time.</p>

<p>"Mr. Rambo," began Angy, singing the
words in a child-like, embarrassed manner, "you
are engaged in the business of raising cattle,
are you not?"</p>

<p>The district attorney winced at this, but
Angevine Thorne did not take advantage of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
his discovery. He also wanted a jury of
twelve cowmen, though he did not show his
hand.</p>

<p>"Very good," he observed, "and I suppose,
Mr. Rambo, that you are acquainted with the
law in this case which makes it a felony for
any man to mark or brand the stock of another
man? Very good. Have you any prejudice
against that law, Mr. Rambo? You believe
that it should be enforced impartially, do you
not—against the rich as well as the poor?
Very good. Pass the juror!"</p>

<p>For a moment Shepherd Kilkenny could
hardly believe his ears. The drift of every
one of the questions had led naturally up to a
challenge and yet at the end Angy had passed
the juror. He glanced quickly at the innocent
face of his opponent, opened his mouth
to speak, and then hurried on with his examination.
The second man was interested in the
cattle business, too; and when Angy passed
him the judge felt called upon to speak.</p>

<p>"You know, do you not, Mr. Thorne," he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
said, "that it is your privilege to excuse any
juror whose occupation or condition of mind
might indicate a prejudice against your client?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, Your Honor," replied Mr.
Thorne, suavely, "but I have perfect confidence
in the integrity of the two gentlemen
just passed. I feel sure that they will do full
justice to Mr. Dalhart."</p>

<p>"Very well, then," said His Honor, "let the
examination proceed!"</p>

<p>With all the address of a good tactician who
sees that his opponent has mistaken a two-spot
for an ace, Shepherd Kilkenny flew at his
task, but each time that Angy passed one of
his cowmen he paused just the fraction of a
second, glanced apprehensively about the room,
and rubbed his chin thoughtfully. The defence
was playing right into his hand, but he
didn't know whether he liked it or not. When
it came to the peremptory challenges he excused
two health-seekers and a mining man,
but Thorne did not challenge a man. Once
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
more the clerk shook the names out of his box
and within half an hour the district attorney
had the very jury he wanted—every man of
them interested in the cattle business and
ready to cinch a rustler as they would kill a
rattlesnake. It seemed almost too good to be
true. Even the staid judge was concerned,
for he had a sober sense of justice and Angy's
appointment had been slightly irregular; but
after a long look at that individual he motioned
for the trial to proceed. The evidence
was all against the defendant anyway, and he
could cut off a year or two on the sentence to
make amends.</p>

<p>"Swear the jurors!" he said, and holding up
their rope-scarred hands and looking coldly
across the room at the alleged rustler, the
twelve cowmen swore to abide by the law and
the evidence and a true verdict find. Then
the district attorney pulled his notes from his
hip-pocket as a man might draw a deadly
weapon and began his opening statement to the
jury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your Honor and gentlemen of the jury,"
he said, "in the case of the People of the
Territory of Arizona <i>versus</i> Pecos Dalhart, we
shall show that on or about the eighth day of
May the said Pecos Dalhart did wilfully, feloniously,
and unlawfully pursue, rope, and
brand a calf, said calf being the property of
Isaac Crittenden of Verde Crossing, Territory
of Arizona; that the said Pecos Dalhart was
arrested and, upon being taken before a magistrate,
he did plead 'Not guilty' and was
held for the grand jury, which handed down an
indictment against him; that upon being arraigned
before the judge he did plead 'Not
guilty' and was remanded for trial upon the
crime charged in the indictment, to wit:—that
he did feloniously and unlawfully mark, brand,
or alter the brand on a neat animal, to wit, one
red-and-white spotted calf, said calf being the
property of Isaac Crittenden, of Verde Crossing,
Territory of Arizona, contrary to the
form, force, and effect of the statute in such
case made and provided and against the peace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
and dignity of the People of the Territory of
Arizona. Mr. Crittenden, will you please take
the stand!"</p>

<p>All the other witnesses had been relegated to
the jury-room, where they would be beyond
the sound of the court, but being the complaining
witness Isaac Crittenden was entitled to
remain and he sat just behind the district attorney,
fumbling with the high collar that
galled his scrawny neck and rolling his evil
eye upon the assemblage. As he rose up from
his place and mounted the witness stand a rumble
of comment passed through the hall and
the sheriff struck his gavel sharply for order.</p>

<p>"Swear the witness, Mr. Clerk," directed
the judge, and raising his right hand in the
air Isaac Crittenden rose and faced the court,
looking a trifle anxious and apprehensive, as
befits one who is about to swear to a lie. Also,
not being used to actions in court, he entertained
certain illusions as to the sanctity of an
oath, illusions which were, however, speedily
banished by the professional disrespect of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
clerk. Reaching down under the table for a
penholder which he had dropped and holding
one hand weakly above his head he recited with
parrot-like rapidity the wearisome formula of
the oath:—"Do you solemnly swear that the
evidence you are about to give in the case of
the People <i>versus</i> Pecos Dalhart shall be the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
truth, s'elpyougod?"</p>

<p>Crittenden blinked his good eye and sat
down. There was nothing very impressive
about the proceeding, but all the same he was
liable for perjury.</p>

<p>"Calling your attention to the eighth day of
May, of the present year, where were you on
that day, Mr. Crittenden?" It was the first
gun in the real engagement and the surging
crowd about the doors quit scrouging for a
view and poised their heads to listen. The
voice of the district attorney was very quiet
and reassuring, and Isaac Crittenden, taking
his cue, answered with the glib readiness of a
previous understanding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span></p>

<p>"I was gathering cattle with my cowboys
near my ranch at Verde Crossing."</p>

<p>"And upon returning to your home did you
encounter any one in the deep <i>arroyo</i> which
lies above your ranch?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," responded Crittenden, "I come
across Pecos Dalhart."</p>

<p>"Is this the gentleman to whom you refer?"
inquired Kilkenny, pointing an accusing
thumb toward Pecos. "Very good, then—you
identify the defendant. Now, Mr. Crittenden,
what was the defendant doing at that
time?"</p>

<p>"He had a spotted calf of mine strung out
by a little fire and was alterin' the brand with
a runnin' iron." Old Crit's eye wandered instinctively
to Pecos Dalhart as he spoke and
gleamed with a hidden fire, but his face was as
expressionless as a death mask.</p>

<p>"I offer the following animal in evidence,"
said the district attorney, beckoning toward
the side door. "Bring in the exhibit!" And as
Bill Todhunter appeared, sheepishly leading
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
the spotted calf, which had been boarded all
summer in town, he threw out his hand dramatically
and hissed:</p>

<p>"Do you identify this animal? Is that the
calf?"</p>

<p>"I do!" responded Crit. "It is the same animal!"</p>

<p>"That's all!" announced Kilkenny, and
with a grin of triumph he summoned the hawk-eyed
jurymen to inspect the brand. There it
was, written on the spotted side of the calf, in
ineffaceable lines—the plain record of Pecos
Dalhart's crime, burned with his own hands.
Across the older scar of Isaac Crittenden's
brand there ran a fresh-burnt bar, and below
the barred Spectacle was a Monkey-wrench,
seared in the tender hide. To a health-seeker
or a mining man the significance of those
marks might be hidden, but the twelve cowmen
on the jury read it like a book. Only one
thing gave them a passing uneasiness—Crit's
Spectacle brand was very evidently devised
to burn over Pecos Dalhart's Monkey-wrench,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
but that was beside the point. They
were there to decide whether Pecos Dalhart
had stolen that particular spotted calf, and the
markings said that he did. By that broad bar
which ran through the pair of Spectacles he
deprived Isaac Crittenden of its ownership,
and by the Monkey-wrench burned below he
took it for his own. All right then,—they retired
to their seats and Angevine Thorne took
the witness.</p>

<p>They faced each other for a minute—the
man who had committed a crime and covered
it, and the man who had sworn to expose his
guilt—and began their fencing warily.</p>

<p>"Mr. Crittenden," purred Angy, "you are
in the cattle business, are you not? Yes, indeed;
and about how many cattle have you
running on your range?"</p>

<p>"I don't know!" answered Crittenden
gruffly.</p>

<p>"At the last time you paid your taxes you
were assessed for about ten thousand, were you
not? Quite correct; I have the statement of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
the assessor here to verify it. Now, Mr. Crittenden,
kindly tell the jury what per cent of
those cattle are calves?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Crit.</p>

<p>"No?" said Angy, with assumed surprise.
"Well then, I hope the court will excuse me
for presuming to tell a cowman about cows
but the percentage of calves on an ordinary
range is between fifty and sixty per cent. So,
according to that you have on your range between
five and six thousand calves, have you
not? Very good. And now, Mr. Crittenden,
speaking roughly, about how many of your cattle
are solid color?"</p>

<p>"I don't know!" scowled Crit.</p>

<p>"You don't know," repeated Angy gravely.
"Very good. I wish the court to note that
Mr. Crittenden is a very poor observer. Now,
Mr. Crittenden, you have stated that you do
not know how many cattle you have; nor how
many of said cattle are calves; nor how
many of said calves are solid color or spotted.
Will you kindly inform the court, then, how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
you know that the calf which has been produced
in evidence is yours?"</p>

<p>"Well—" said Crittenden, and then he
stopped. The one thing which he was afraid
of in this trial was about to happen—Angy
was going to corner him on the maternity of the
calf, and that would make him out a cow-thief.
The district attorney scowled at him to go
ahead and then, in order to cover up the failure,
he leapt to his feet and cried:</p>

<p>"Your Honor, I object to the line of questioning
on the ground that it is irrelevant, incompetent,
and immaterial!"</p>

<p>"If the court please," spoke up Angevine
Thorne, "the witness has positively identified
the calf in question as his own, although it is a
matter of record that he possesses four or five
thousand calves, all of which have been born
within the past year and over half of which are
spotted. It is the purpose of the defence to
prove that this calf does not belong to the
witness; that it was the property of Pecos
Dalhart at the time the alleged crime was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
committed, <i>and that it had been previously
stolen by Isaac Crittenden</i>!"</p>

<p>As he shouted these words Angy pointed an
accusing finger at Old Crit, who started back
like a man who had been struck, and while
the clamor of deputies and bailiffs filled the
court-room they stood there like the figures in a
tableau, glaring at each other with inextinguishable
hatred.</p>

<p>"Order in the court! Order in the court!"
cried the bailiffs, beating back the crowd, and
when the assembly had been quieted the judge
motioned to Angy to proceed.</p>

<p>"Objection is overruled," he said, and bent
his dark brows upon Isaac Crittenden. "Let
the witness answer the question."</p>

<p>"Well, the calf had my brand on it," responded
Crittenden defiantly, and then, egged
on by Angy's sarcastic smile, he went a step
too far. "Yes, and I know him, too!" he
blurted out. "I'd know that calf among a
thousand, by them spots across his face."</p>

<p>"Oh, you would, would you?" spoke up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
Angy quickly. "You have a distinct recollection
of the animal on account of its peculiar
markings then; is that right? Very good.
When did you put your brand on that calf,
Mr. Crittenden?"</p>

<p>"Last Spring," replied Crittenden grudgingly.</p>

<p>"You know the law regarding the branding
of calves," prompted Angy. "Was the
calf with its mother at the time?"</p>

<p>"It was!"</p>

<p>"And did she bear the same brand that you
burned upon her calf?"</p>

<p>"She did!"</p>

<p>"Any other brands?"</p>

<p>"Nope!"</p>

<p>"Raised her yourself, did you?"</p>

<p>"<i>Yes!</i>" shouted Crittenden angrily.</p>

<p>"That's all!" said Angy briefly, and Isaac
Crittenden sank back into his chair, dazed at
the very unexpectedness of his escape. It
was a perilous line of questioning that his
former roustabout had taken up, leading close
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
to the stealing of Upton's cattle and the seizing
of Pecos Dalhart's herd, but at the very
moment when he might have sprung the mine
Angy had withheld his hand. The gaunt
cowman tottered to his seat in a smother of
perspiration, and Shepherd Kilkenny, after a
moment's consideration, decided to make his
hand good by calling a host of witnesses.</p>

<p>They came into court, one after the other,
the hard-faced gun-men that Crittenden kept
about his place, and with the unblinking assurance
of men who gamble even with life
itself they swore to the stereotyped facts, while
Angy said never a word.</p>

<p>"The People rest!" announced the district
attorney at last, and lay back smiling in his
chair to see what his opponent would spring.</p>

<p>"Your Honor and gentlemen of the jury,"
began Angevine Thorne, speaking with the
easy confidence of a barrister, "the prosecution
has gone to great lengths to prove that Pecos
Dalhart branded this calf. The defence
freely admits that act, but denies all felonious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
intent. We will show you, gentlemen of the
jury, that at the time he branded the animal
it was by law and right his own, and that during
his absence it had been feloniously and unlawfully
branded into the Spectacle brand by
the complaining witness, Isaac Crittenden.
Mr. Dalhart, will you please take the stand!"</p>

<p>Awkward and shamefaced in the presence
of the multitude and painfully conscious of
his jail clothes, Pecos mounted to the stand
and turned to face his inquisitor. They had
rehearsed the scene before—for Babe Thorne
was not altogether ignorant of a lawyer's wiles—and
his examination went off as smoothly as
Kilkenny's examination of Crit, down to the
point where Pecos was rudely pounced upon
and roped while he was branding his spotted
calf. Then it was that Angevine Thorne's
voice began to ring like a trumpet, and as he
came to the crucial question the audience stood
motionless to listen.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Dalhart," he clarioned, "you say
that you purposely barred the Spectacle brand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
upon this calf and burned your own brand,
which was a Monkey-wrench, below it?
What was your reason for that act?"</p>

<p>"My reason was that the calf was mine!"
cried Pecos, rising angrily to his feet. "When
I first come to Verde Crossing I bought an
old spotted cow and her calf from José Garcia
and branded them with a Monkey-wrench on
the ribs—I kept her around my camp for a
milk cow. That first calf growed up and she
was jest comin' in with another one when I
went to New Mexico last Fall. Well, when I
came back last Spring I hadn't got into town
yet when I come across my old milk cow with
her ears all chopped up and her brand burned
over and this little calf, lookin' jest like her,
with a Spectacle brand burned on his ribs.
That made me mad and I was jest ventin' the
calf back to a Monkey-wrench when Crittenden
and his cowboys jumped in and roped me!"</p>

<p>"You say that you bought the mother of
this calf from José Garcia?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir! I paid him twenty-five dollars
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
for the cow and five dollars for the first
calf."</p>

<p>"What were the brand and markings of this
cow at the time you bought her?"</p>

<p>"She had a Mexican brand, like an Injun
arrer struck by lightning, on her left hip, a
big window or <i>ventano</i> in the left ear, and a
slash and underbit in the right. Garcia vented
his brand on her shoulder and I run a Monkey-wrench—that's
my regular, registered brand—on
her ribs, but I never changed her ear
marks because I kept her for a milk cow anyway."</p>

<p>"Your Honor," interposed Kilkenny, rising
with a bored air to his feet, "I object to this
testimony on the ground that it is irrelevant,
incompetent, and immaterial. I fail to see the
relation of this hypothetical milk cow to the
question before the court."</p>

<p>"The cow in question was the mother of the
calf which my client is accused of stealing!"
cried Angy, panting with excitement as he saw
the moment of his triumph approaching.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
"She was sold to the defendant and he had a
legal right to her offspring. Can a man steal
his own property, Your Honor? Most assuredly
not! I wish to produce that cow in
evidence and I will bring competent witnesses
to prove that she belongs by rights to Pecos
Dalhart. Bring in the exhibit, Mr. Todhunter!"</p>

<p>He waved his hand toward the side door
and as Kilkenny saw the <i>coup</i> which had been
sprung on him he burst into a storm of protest.
"I object, Your Honor!" he shouted,
"I object!"</p>

<p>"Objection overruled!" pronounced the
judge. "Let the cow be brought in as quickly
as possible and after the examination of the
exhibit we will proceed at once to the argument."</p>

<p>He paused, and as the crowd that blocked
the side door gave way before the bailiffs, Old
Funny-face was dragged unwillingly into
court and led to the sand boat to join her
calf. At the first sight of her dun-colored
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
face and spotted neck every man in the jury-box
looked at his neighbor knowingly. They
were cowmen, every one of them used to picking
out mothers by hair-marks in the corral
cut, and Old Funny-face was a dead ringer
for her calf. Even to the red blotch across
his dun face the calf was the same, and when
Funny-face indignantly repulsed its advances
they were not deceived, for a cow soon forgets
her offspring, once it is taken away. But
most of all their trained eyes dwelt upon
the mangled ears, the deep swallow fork in
the left and the short crop in the right, and the
record of the brands on her side. There was
the broken arrow, just as Pecos had described
it, and the vent mark on the shoulder. It
would take some pretty stiff swearing to make
them believe that that Spectacle brand on her
ribs had not been burnt over a Monkey-wrench.
It was Angy's inning now, and with a flourish
he called Pecos to the stand and had him identify
his cow; but when he called José Garcia,
and José, gazing trustfully into Angy's eyes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
testified that she was his old milk cow and he
had, <i>sin duda</i>, sold her to Pecos Dalhart for
twenty-five dollars, the self-composed Kilkenny
began to rave with questions, while
Crittenden broke into a cold sweat. Not only
was the case going against him, but it threatened
to leave him in the toils. It was too late
to stop Garcia now—he had said his say and
gone into a sullen silence—there was nothing
for it but to swear, and swear hard. Kilkenny
was on his toes, swinging his clenched
fist into the hollow of his hand and raging at the
witness, when Crittenden suddenly dragged
him down by the coat-tails and began to
whisper into his ear. Instantly the district
attorney was all attention; he asked a question,
and then another; nodded, and addressed the
court.</p>

<p>"Your Honor," he said, "I will excuse the
witness and ask to call others in rebuttal.
Will you take the chair, Mr. Crittenden!"</p>

<p>Old Crit advanced to the stand and faced
the court-room, a savage gleam in his eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you recognize this cow, Mr. Crittenden?"
inquired Kilkenny mildly.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I know her well. She's an old
gentle cow that's been hangin' around my corral
for years. I took her from Joe Garcia,
last Spring, for some money he was owin' me."</p>

<p>"What?" yelled Angy, springing up from
his chair, "do you mean to say—"</p>

<p>"I object, Your Honor!" clamored Kilkenny
desperately. "I object! The witness
is mine!"</p>

<p>"The People's witness," ruled the judge;
"let the examination proceed."</p>

<p>"Is this cow the mother of the calf in question—do
you identify her as the mother of
this calf?"</p>

<p>"I do!" repeated Crittenden solemnly.
"And you can summon any of my cowboys—they'll
swear to her."</p>

<p>"Take the witness!" said Kilkenny, leering
at Angevine Thorne, and in spite of all Angy
could do Crit stuck to his story, word for
word. One after the other his cowboys took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
the chair, glanced at their boss, and identified
the cow and calf. Kilkenny had won, and
before Babe Thorne could collect his wits he
plunged into his closing argument.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen of the jury," he cried, "the
people of Geronimo County are looking to you
to-day to vindicate justice in the courts. It is
the shame of Geronimo County—spoken
against her by all the world—that not a single
cattle-thief has ever been convicted in her
courts. Men have been tried; their guilt has
been demonstrated to a moral certainty; but
the evidence has been insufficient, and they have
escaped. Gentlemen of the jury, a year and
a half ago the defendant in this case came to
Geronimo County without a cent; he went to
work for Mr. Crittenden, who kindly took him
in; but within a few months, gentlemen of the
jury, Pecos Dalhart left the service of his benefactor
and moved to Lost Dog Cañon. Six
months later, gentlemen, when the sheriff at
the risk of his life rode into his guilty hiding-place,
Mr. Dalhart had <i>two hundred head of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
cattle</i> shut up in a secret pasture! <i>Two</i>—<i>hundred</i>—<i>head</i>,
gentlemen; and he defied the
sheriff of this county <i>to even collect the taxes</i>
upon those cattle! Gentlemen of the jury,
I ask you, Where did this man get those two
hundred head of cattle? Did he bring them
with him? No, for the evidence shows that he
rode in alone. Did he buy them? No, for he
had no money. Gentlemen of the jury, that
man who sits before you <i>stole</i> those cattle, and
he does not dare to deny it!"</p>

<p>He paused and looked about the court-room,
and a great hush came upon the entire
assembly. Every man in the crowded standing
room stood silent and the surge of those
without the doorway died down in a tremor of
craning heads. Kilkenny had won—but he
had not finished. Point by point he went over
the chain of his evidence, testing every link to
prove that it was true, and then in a final outburst
of frenzy he drove the last point home.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen of the jury," he said, in closing,
"the defendant stands before you, convicted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
by his own words. He acknowledges that he
branded the calf; he acknowledges that he set
at defiance all law and justice and robbed the
man who had befriended him—and what is
his defence? That Isaac Crittenden had
robbed him of his cow! Isaac Crittenden, who
has cattle on a thousand hills! A man known,
and favorably known, in this community for
twenty years! Gentlemen, I ask of you,
whose word will you take in this matter? The
word of this self-confessed cattle-rustler and
his Mexican consort or the word of Isaac Crittenden
of Verde Crossing? Gentlemen of the
jury, it has been the shame of Geronimo
County for many years that this practice of
rustling cattle has never received its fitting rebuke.
It has been the shame of Arizona that
the rights of the cattle men, the men who dared
the Indians and braved the desert and made
this country what it is, have never been protected.
You have seen what this negligence has
brought to our near neighbor, Tonto County—a
cattle war in which over fifty men have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
given up their lives; a beautiful cattle country,
devastated of all its flocks and herds. It
has brought death, gentlemen, and destruction
of property, and—<i>bankruptcy</i>! Gentlemen,
I ask you for a verdict of 'Guilty'!"</p>

<p>He sat down, and Angevine Thorne rose
to his feet, bewildered. The speech which he
had prepared to save his friend was forgotten;
the appeals which he could have made were
dead. He gazed about the court and read in
every eye the word that was still ringing in
his ears: "Guilty!" And yet he knew that
Pecos was not guilty. Cattle he had stolen,
yes—but not the cattle in court. They, of
all the animals he had owned, had been honestly
acquired; but Old Crit had sworn him into
prison. It was right, perhaps, but it was not
Law—and it was the law that held him. As
he looked at the forbidding faces before him,
each one hard and set by the false words of
Crit and Shepherd Kilkenny, the monstrous
injustice of the thing rushed over him and he
opened his lips to speak. It was a conspiracy—a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
hellish combination of lawyers and the men
they served, to beat the poor man down. The
old rage for the revolution, the rage which he
had put so resolutely from his heart, rushed
back and choked him; he scowled at the sneering
district attorney and Old Crit, humped
over in his chair; and turned to the glowering
audience, searching with the orator's instinct
for a single friendly face. But there was
none; every man was against him—every
one! He raised his hand to heaven—and
stopped. There was a struggle in the doorway—a
bailiff, tall and burly, was thrusting
back a young girl who struggled to get free—and
then like a flash of light Babe Thorne
saw her face, the wild-eyed, piteous face of
Marcelina!</p>

<p>"Here!" he commanded, leaping upon a
chair and pointing with an imperious hand.
"Let that girl in! Your Honor, I demand
that that girl be let in! This trial is her trial,
Your Honor—she is Marcelina Garcia, my
friend's affianced bride!" In that single moment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
he saw it—the last desperate chance to
save his friend—a sentimental appeal to the
jury! How many men have been saved from
prison and gallows and the just punishment of
their crimes by such a ruse! Given the aged
mother, the despairing wife, the sweetheart,
clinging to his hand, and all the thunderings
of Jove will fail of conviction. The law and
the evidence are nothing; Reason is dethroned
and Justice tips her scales to send the prisoner
free. With a surly frown the bailiff let go his
hold and like a hunted creature that flees from
the memory of her pursuers Marcelina ran
panting down the aisle and threw herself at
the feet of the just judge.</p>

<p>"Oh, Meester," she cried, holding up her
hands, "do not send Paycos to preeson! Look,
here are the ears of Old Funny-face, his cow,
what Ol' Creet stole while he was gone!
Paycos did not steal the cow—no, no! He
buy heem from my papa, and this is <i>mi padre's</i>
mark!" She unwound the blue silk handkerchief
that encased them and thrust into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
hands of the astounded judge—<i>two ears!</i>
With eager glances she held them up—the
keys which Old Crit had cut from Funny-face's
ears on the day that he stole Pecos's
herd—and thrust her brown finger through
the Mexican <i>ventano</i>. Then, impatient of her
English, she snatched them back and, scampering
back to where Old Funny-face still stood
on the sand boat, she fitted the crop and swallow-fork
back into the mangled ears.</p>

<p>"Look! Look!" she cried, "these are the
dried-up ears what Ol' Creet cut from my
Paycos's cow, that day when he stole his cattle.
My leetle brothers bring them from the corral
to play with and I hide them, to show to Paycos.
Meester, he is bad man, that Creet! He—he—"</p>

<p>She faltered and started back. There before
her, humped over in his chair, sat Isaac
Crittenden, and his one eye covered her like
the evil glare of a rattlesnake.</p>

<p>"<i>Santa Maria!</i>" she gasped. "<i>Madre de
Dios! Creet!</i>" And with a scared sob she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
turned and ran to Babe. It was an affecting
scene, but Babe did not overdo it.</p>

<p>"Your Honor," he said, speaking over her
bowed head with portentous calm, "I wish to
offer these two ears in evidence as an exhibit
in this case. One of them, you will notice, is
cut in a swallow-fork and exhibits, above, the
<i>ventano</i> which defendant testified belonged to
the mother of this calf; the other is cropped
short and exhibits the slash and Mexican <i>anzuelo</i>;
both of them show the peculiar red and
white spots which gave to the cow in question
the name of Funny-face. After the jury has
inspected the exhibit I will ask that Marcelina
Garcia be sworn."</p>

<p>It was not a long speech and had nothing
of dramatic appeal; and yet as it came out,
this was Angevine Thorne's closing speech.
When he saw how the pendulum had swung, 
Shepherd Kilkenny, the fighting district attorney,
went into a black, frowning silence
and refused to speak to Old Crit; but as the
judge began his instructions to the jury he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
suddenly roused up and beckoned to Boone
Morgan. They whispered together while the
law was being read and then the sheriff went
over and spoke a few words to Pecos Dalhart.</p>

<p>"Sure!" nodded Pecos, and at the signal
Shepherd Kilkenny rose quickly to his feet.</p>

<p>"Your Honor," he said, bowing apologetically
to the judge, "in consideration of the evidence
which has just been introduced I wish to
withdraw my former request to the jury, and I
now ask for a verdict of 'Not guilty.'" He
sat down, and a hum went up from the crowded
court-room like the zooning of swarming bees.
There was something coming—something
tremendous—that they all knew; and when
the verdict was given not a man moved from
his place. Then Boone Morgan rose up from
beside the district attorney and touched Isaac
Crittenden on the shoulder. There was nothing
rough about it, and Crittenden followed
without a word, but the significance was plain.
The man who had sworn others into prison had
done as much for himself, and it would take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
a Philadelphia lawyer to turn him loose. He
had sworn that the cow was his, and the ear
keys showed that he lied. Swallow-fork and
crop, and Mexican marks above, and Old
Funny-face, wagging her mangled ears in
court! There had never been a cow-thief convicted
in the Geronimo courts, and Old Crit
would spend every cent he had to keep out
of jail, but if Shepherd Kilkenny could not
get him on evidence like that, then tyranny is
dead and the devil has lost his claws.</p>

</div>

<p class="ac">NEVER AGAIN</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE District Court of Geronimo County
broke up like a stampede of cattle when
Ike Crittenden was placed under arrest,
and in the general scramble Angevine Thorne
was seized by a band of determined men
and rushed to the Big Adobe bar. The
committee on public entertainment had set
their hearts on a speech, and they would not
be denied. Meanwhile Pecos Dalhart was
borne off as inexorably in the other direction
by Boone Morgan and Shepherd Kilkenny,
and not until he had sworn to the complaint
and testified against Old Crit before the J. P.
would they let him go his way. First on the
programme which he had mapped out for himself
was a big feed at Hung Wo's restaurant,
and Charley Hung Wo was so happy over his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
release that he refused to accept a cent. That
was right friendly of Charley and shows what
a good fellow a Chink can be—give him a
chance. It cheered Pecos up, and after he
had got a new outfit of clothes all around and
scoured the jail smell out of his skin he began
to feel like a white man again. The hot sunshine
felt good on his cheek, the wind smelled
sweet, and he liked the clump of board sidewalks
beneath his feet; but at the same time
he was lonely. Somehow he did not seem to
fit into this great outer world any more—there
was no place to go and nothing to do;
that is, nothing but throw in with Babe Thorne
and get drunk, and even that had its disadvantages.</p>

<p>Lighting a cigar and wandering down the
street Pecos pondered upon the matter and
finally decided to hunt up Angy and see if
anything could be done. Taking advantage
of the general preoccupation he managed to
fight his way through the crowded portals of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
the Big Adobe Saloon unobserved and there,
surrounded by the heaving multitude, he
stopped to listen. A committee of citizens
had just presented Colonel Thorne with the
keys of the town, appended to which as a
further token of regard was a drink check on
the Big Adobe—good for life. Mr. Thorne
had evidently taken a few of the drinks already
and mellowed to the mood of his admirers; for
when Pecos arrived he was midway in a flamboyant
speech of declination.</p>

<p>"No, gentlemen," he was saying, "much as
I appreciate the honor conferred upon me by
your kind invitation, I can never accept the
nomination for such an office. What, shall
men say in times to come that Angevine
Thorne, after freeing his friend from the
clutches of the law, turned traitor to the common
people and became the district attorney?
Never! Nay, if I were prosecuting attorney
I would prosecute the judge and the jury, the
rich corporations and cattle kings, and all who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
make the law a scourge for the poor and lowly.
Never, never, never, shall the word go
forth—"</p>

<p>That was enough for Pecos—he saw that
he was not needed. True, he had promised
Angy a drink from which Geronimo should
date time, but the citizens' committee had taken
all that off his hands. Pulling his hat down
over his eyes he struggled out into the deserted
street and looked around like a lost
dog—then with a sigh he turned and made
his way back to the jail. It was the only
home he had now. On one shoulder he bore a
box of apples—a last gift for the boys inside—and
as he stepped in through the sliding
doors and saw them come swarming out
from their cells to greet him he regarded them
almost with affection. For six months he had
been alcalde in that jail, laying down the law
with fist and strap, and now he must resign.
As his sheriff attended to the distribution of
the fruit Pecos stepped into his little cell,
shoved the worn Bible into his pocket and got
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
his strap; then, after a hurried word with
Boone Morgan through the bars, he mounted
on the alcalde's chair and addressed them.</p>

<p>"Boys," he said, "luck come my way and
I'm goin' to leave you. You'll have to have
a new alcalde now and I only ask one thing
before I go. They're goin' to throw a big,
tall, hump-backed dastard in here pretty soon.
He's only got one eye, but he's got lots of
money and I want you to kangaroo him to
the limit, and give him <i>this</i> for contempt of
court!" He raised the broad strap in the air.
"Will you do it?" he yelled, and when they
answered with a roar he hurled it into their
midst.</p>

<p>"All right then; fight for it, you tarriers!"
he shouted, "<i>and the one that gits it is alcalde</i>!"</p>

<p>They fought, and when it was over Pecos
Dalhart stepped out of jail, a free man. It
is a fine thing to be free, but freedom carries
with it certain obligations, one of which is to
keep out of jail. Pecos glanced into the jag-cell
in passing and decided not to get drunk,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
at any rate. Then he went down to the office
with Boone Morgan.</p>

<p>"Well, Pecos," said that genial official, shaking
out a bunch of keys, "you might as well
take your property envelope and what money
you got left—unless you expect to be back
soon," he hinted. "By the way, what you goin'
to do after you sober up?"</p>

<p>"Well, I dunno," said Pecos, scratching his
head. "I could go back up on the Verde, now
Old Crit's in jail, and burn them Spectacle
cows he stole off of me back into a Hock-sign—two
bars and another circle would make a
three-ball sign, all right—but I've quit that
line of business. Look at Crit!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" grunted the sheriff, "think you'll
quit rustlin', eh? But say, how come you
ain't drunk already? I had a little business I
wanted to talk over with you, but I thought
I'd better wait till you blew off."</p>

<p>"Nope, no more booze for me!" declared
Pecos virtuously. "You fellers never git me
in <i>here</i> no more. You come so dam' near
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
sendin' me to Yuma for somethin' I never done
that I'm goin' to be mighty careful what I
<i>do</i>!" He paused and gazed sombrely out of
the window and a new courage—the courage
of clean clothes and freedom—drew him on to
speak. "This is a hell of a thing you call the
law," he observed, "now ain't it? How much
of a show does a poor man git in your courts
with Shepherd Kilkenny ravin' for his life?
I'm goin' to git on a good horse and ride, and
ride, and ride, until I git away from that
dastard; that's what I'm goin' to do!"</p>

<p>The sheriff had laid out the familiar property
envelope and was twirling the combination
of his safe, but at this last outburst he
stopped short.</p>

<p>"You'll do nothing of the kind," he said
shortly. "I been tryin' for two years to get
Ike Crittenden for stealing cows, and I want
you to stay in Geronimo County until we get
him <i>cinched</i>! Are you goin' to do it?"</p>

<p>For an instant Pecos met his eye defiantly;
then the memory of other cows that he <i>had</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
stolen rose up in his mind and he nodded his
head.</p>

<p>"Sure!" he said, "I'll be your star witness."</p>

<p>"All right then," grumbled the sheriff, turning
morosely away from his safe, "but bein'
as you seem to be making medicine against the
law again I jest want to ask you a few questions.
You say the law is a hell of a thing—and
it is; I admit it. And the poor man don't
have no show against it—that's a fact, too.
But here's what I want to know—what you
goin' to do about it? How long do you think
it will take to change the law so a poor man
will have an even break with a rich one, the
way things are goin'? 'Bout a thousand years,
hey? Well, I call that conservative. But
say, do you expect to live that long? No?
Think you can hurry it up any by buckin'
against the law? Well, what you goin' to do
about it—spend your time in jail?"</p>

<p>"Well, it ain't right," muttered Pecos,
"that's all I got to say. Jest look at your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
dam' law!" he cried, the memory of his wrongs
getting the better of him; "look at <i>me</i>! Kep'
six months in jail before I could git a trial—d'
you call that right?"</p>

<p>"Nope," said Boone Morgan calmly, "but
what you goin' to do about it? I mean <i>you</i>,
now! D' you think you can mend matters any
by gettin' thrown into jail? I got my eye on
you, and that's just where you'll land. Sure,
the law is rotten, but what you goin' to <i>do</i>
about it?"</p>

<p>The coldblooded insistence of the man
jangled on Pecos's nerves and made him pass
it back.</p>

<p>"Well, what <i>can</i> a feller do?" he demanded
savagely.</p>

<p>"Keep out of trouble—don't break the law—that's
all!" rumbled the sheriff, fixing him
with his masterful eyes. He turned slowly
back to the combination of his safe, twirling
the tumblers while the wisdom of his words
went home; then he threw open the door, drew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
out a large official envelope, and balanced it in
his hand. "Well," he challenged, looking
Pecos in the eye, "ain't that right?"</p>

<p>Pecos pondered upon it a minute longer,
much as he had studied on Crit's proposition
that it is no crime to rob a thief, and right
there the cause of the revolution lost another
fervent disciple.</p>

<p>"By God, Boone," he said, "I believe you're
right!"</p>

<p>"W'y, of course I'm right!" cried Morgan,
slapping him jovially on the back; "and there's
a thousand dollars to prove it!"</p>

<p>He tore open the official envelope and thrust
a sheaf of bills into the astonished cowboy's
hands.</p>

<p>"Money talks," he observed sententiously,
"only there're some people have such a roarin'
in the ears they can't hear it. This roll of
velvet is what's left from the tax sale of those
Monkey-wrench cows I seized, and it says that
you are a capitalist, with all the errors and
prejudices of your class. Just put that into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
cows now, and look after 'em, and you'll forget
all about the revolution."</p>

<p>"Hell's fire!" ejaculated Pecos, shutting
down on the money. "You don't mean to say
this is all mine?"</p>

<p>"That's right. I tried to give it to you
last Fall, up there at Verde Crossing, but you
heard the wind in your ears, clean to New
Mexico. Guess your conscience was kind of
troublin' you, hey?"</p>

<p>"Umm," answered Pecos absently. He
was studying on how to spend his money.
For several minutes he sat thumbing over the
new bills and gazing out into the twilight;
then he jammed them deep into his pocket and
started for the door.</p>

<p>"Hey! Where you goin'?" shouted Boone
Morgan, as he clattered down the steps.
"Come back here and get this property envelope!
You must've had an idee," he ventured,
as Pecos reappeared.</p>

<p>"Yep," said Pecos, "an' a good one." He
dumped the contents of his envelope on top of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
the desk and regarded the articles fixedly.
There, sparkling brightly as when he first
bought it, was the eighteen-carat, solitaire-diamond
engagement-ring.</p>

<p>"That ought to come in pretty handy now,"
suggested the sheriff, pointing to it with the
butt of his cigar.</p>

<p>"Nope," replied Pecos noncommittally,
"too late now."</p>

<p>"That's bad," commented Boone Morgan
sociably. "Mighty pretty girl, too. All off,
hey?"</p>

<p>Pecos looked him over carefully, grunted,
and started for the door.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to tell just how it happened
so, but as Pecos Dalhart, with a firm
resolve in his heart, dashed down the steps once
more, his eye caught a darker shadow in the
dusky corner of the jail and he stopped dead
in his tracks. Then as his vision became adjusted
to the twilight he walked slowly over
toward the corner, where a woman's figure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
was crouched against the wall. It was Marcelina,
worn, draggled, and tear-stained, and as
she gazed up at him from beneath her tangled
hair his heart stopped in its beat.</p>

<p>"Ah, Paycos," she murmured brokenly,
"where can I go? The seesters lock me up
in hi-igh room, for run away to see you. Two
day I cry <i>todo-tiempo</i> because you no have
ears—then I jump out of window to breeng
them. Now I can not go home. An', Paycos,"
she rose up suddenly and moved toward
him, "I am 'fraid! I am 'fraid Ol' Creet will
catch me!"</p>

<p>"Crit nothin'!" said Pecos scornfully.
"Come on over here—what's the matter with
you?" He gathered her into his arms and
held her close a minute.</p>

<p>"You ain't scairt now, are you?" he inquired
tenderly.</p>

<p>"A-ah, no!" sighed Marcelina, nestling
against his breast.</p>

<p>"Well, gimme that kiss, then," said Pecos.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span></p>

<p>There were no wedding bells at Pecos Dalhart's
marriage—that takes too much time—but
the county clerk gave him a license right
away, Boone Morgan went along for a witness,
and the J. P. did the rest. It was the same
J. P. who had held Pecos for cattle-rustling,
but what of that? Upon such an occasion the
past is forgotten and we care little what hand it
is that confers our greatest happiness. Pecos
pressed a ten-dollar bill into the guilt-stained
palm of the magistrate and then, while his
roll was out, he peeled off another bill and
handed it to Boone Morgan.</p>

<p>"Give that to Angy when he comes to," he
said, "and tell 'im to hunt me up. Don't
know where we'll live yet, but it wouldn't be
like home without old Babe—would it, Marcelina?"</p>

<p>"Ah, Paycos," breathed Marcelina, gazing
up at him with adoring eyes, "you are such a
<i>goo-ood</i> man!"</p>

<p>The rustler glanced doubtfully over his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
shoulder at Boone Morgan, grinned, and
passed out into the starlit night.</p>

<p>"All right, Chiquita," he said. "You got a
monopoly on that idee—but whatever you
say, goes!"</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site

to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
